title: Improper input validation of console codes
cve:   CVE-2024-35164
fixed: 1.6.0
reporters: Tizian Seehaus (Tibotix)
---

The terminal emulator of Apache Guacamole 1.5.5 and older does not properly
validate console codes received from servers via text-based protocols like SSH.
If a malicious user has access to a text-based connection, a specially-crafted
sequence of console codes could allow arbitrary code to be executed with the
privileges of the running guacd process.
