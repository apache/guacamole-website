title: Incorrect calculation of Guacamole protocol element lengths
cve:   CVE-2023-30575
fixed: 1.5.2
---

Apache Guacamole 1.5.1 and older may incorrectly calculate the lengths of
instruction elements sent during the Guacamole protocol handshake, potentially
allowing an attacker to inject Guacamole instructions during the handshake
through specially-crafted data.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Stefan Schiller (Sonar) for reporting
this issue.
