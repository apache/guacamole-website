The 1.5.5 release is a bugfix release that addresses bugs and regressions from
1.5.4 and earlier, including a resource leak that may affect RDP and SSH
connections, and updates all dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
For a full list of all changes in this release, please see the
[changelog](#changelog) below.

**The 1.5.5 release is compatible with older 1.x components.** You should
upgrade older components to 1.5.5 when possible, however things should continue
to work correctly in the interim:

* Extensions written for older 1.x releases can be used by 1.5.5.
* Components written for the version of the Guacamole protocol used by older
  1.x releases can be used with components of the 1.5.5 release.

Regardless of inter-component compatibility, **there are changes in 1.5.5 which
may affect downstream users of Guacamole's APIs**. Please see the [deprecation
/ compatibility notes](#deprecation--compatibility-notes) section for more
information.

Deprecation / Compatibility notes
---------------------------------

Each 1.x release of Apache Guacamole should be compatible with components of
older 1.x releases. This compatibility is intended at the Guacamole protocol
level and at the extension level, but not necessarily at the API level. This
means:

 * Extensions from older 1.x releases should still work in binary form, but may
   need code changes before their source will build against a newer version of
   guacamole-ext.
 * Software which uses the Guacamole protocol of an older 1.x release should
   still work.
 * Software which uses libguac from an older 1.x release should still work by
   continuing to use the libguac from that release, as newer versions of
   libguac may not be API/ABI compatible. In the case of third-party protocol
   support plugins for guacd, this means that the guacd from that release must
   also be used. Compatibility with respect to libguac is represented by the
   [soname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname).
 * You should update to newer versions where applicable and when possible.

As of 1.5.5, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:

### Addition of `socket_lock` to `guac_socket_ssl_data` structure

The internal `guac_socket_ssl_data` structure used by the SSL/TLS variant of
`guac_socket` now contains an additional `pthread_mutex_t` member at its end,
increasing its overall size. Offsets of established structure members are not
affected.

It is unlikely that any external code manually allocates instances of this
structure and passes those instances back to libguac, but any such code would
need to be rebuilt to be compatible.

 * {:.bug} TLS sockets are not synchronized ([GUACAMOLE-1910](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-1910))
