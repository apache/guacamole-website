The 0.9.10-incubating release is Apache Guacamole's first release under the
Apache Incubator. It features support for both screen sharing and recording,
improved file transfer behavior, and support for LDAP within the Docker images.
Local clipboard integration has also been added (for those browsers which
support it), as well as audio input for RDP, theming/branding via extensions,
and several other improvements.


Screen sharing
--------------

Guacamole now supports screen sharing for all protocols, even those which do
not inherently support it, like RDP and SSH. When granted permission, users can
generate temporary share links for their active connections, with those links
being invalidated when they disconnect. The degree of access granted by a share
link is defined by the "sharing profile" used to generate that link.

 * [GUACAMOLE-5](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-5) - Allow creation of per-connection share links
 * [GUACAMOLE-13](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-13) - Finally stabilize and merge GUAC-844 to master
 * [GUACAMOLE-52](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-52) - Do not delete history records


Screen recording
----------------

All supported protocols (VNC, RDP, SSH, and telnet) can now be configured to
record sessions to disk for later playback. These session recordings are
actually Guacamole protocol dumps of the graphical updates being sent from the
Guacamole server to users of that connection. They can be converted to a normal
video stream using the new "guacenc" utility, which is part of the
guacamole-server build.

Additionally, text-based protocols (SSH and telnet) can record sessions as
text, using the same two-file format used by the `script` and `scriptreplay`
commands.

 * [GUACAMOLE-4](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-4) - Implement session recording
 * [GUACAMOLE-16](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-16) - Implement text-based screen recording for SSH/telnet


Streamlined file transfers
--------------------------

The Guacamole web application now handles file transfers via HTTP. This speeds
things up considerably, removes limitations on file size imposed by JavaScript,
and removes the need for manually initiating the actual download by clicking a
link.

File transfer is still handled via the Guacamole protocol. The streams are
dynamically intercepted, stripped, and exposed via HTTP by the web application
in response to specific REST API requests. This is strictly a frontend change
and does not affect the core Guacamole stack and protocol, which continues to
handle file transfer as it always has.

 * [GUACAMOLE-44](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-44) - Upload/download of files that are more than 1 GB fail


RDP audio input
---------------

RDP's `AUDIO_INPUT` channel is now supported. If your RDP server supports audio
input, corresponding support can be enabled on your RDP connections in
Guacamole.

Audio recording only occurs when an application running within the remote
desktop requests access, and then only if that access is granted by the user.
The user will be prompted by their browser to allow or deny access.

 * [GUACAMOLE-25](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-25) - Add support for audio input


Keyboard improvements
---------------------

Use of the numeric keypad was broken in version 0.9.9. This should now be
fixed.

New keymaps for RDP have also been contributed, including  Dutch, Japanese, and
fixes for the existing French layout.

 * [GUACAMOLE-6](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-6) - Netherlands keyboard layout created
 * [GUACAMOLE-7](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-7) - Wrong French keyboard layout
 * [GUACAMOLE-15](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-15) - Japanese keymap support on RDP
 * [GUACAMOLE-19](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-19) - "@" characters don't work with French keyboard under IE11
 * [GUACAMOLE-51](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-51) - Keypad not properly mapped in RDP, SSH, and telnet


Local clipboard integration
---------------------------

Guacamole will now use the [W3C Clipboard
API](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/) (`document.execCommand()`) to
attempt to read the local clipboard. Few browsers allow this in circumstances
compatible with remote desktop, IE11 among them. If this fails, things continue
to work as they have in past releases (clipboard access via the Guacamole
menu/sidebar).

IE11 will prompt the user to allow clipboard access. Other browsers will
typically deny access without any sort of prompt. For Chrome, there is a
third-party extension, [Clipboard Permission
Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-permission-mana/ipbhneeanpgkaleihlknhjiaamobkceh),
which allows the user to grant unrestricted access to the W3C Clipboard API on
a per-domain basis.

 * [GUACAMOLE-24](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-24) - Directly integrate local clipboard


Theming extensions
------------------

Guacamole's extension system now supports modification of the HTML structure
in addition to the authentication and CSS/JavaScript/translation modification
components. This is achieved through specially-formatted HTML "patches",
documented in more detail within the manual.

 * [GUACAMOLE-9](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-9) - Allow modification of HTML via extensions


Docker improvements
-------------------

The Guacamole Docker images have been updated to support LDAP, as well as the
concurrency limit properties of the database authentication backend.

 * [GUACAMOLE-8](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-8) - Allow concurrency properties to be configured within Docker
 * [GUACAMOLE-21](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-21) - Support LDAP within Docker image
 * [GUACAMOLE-27](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-27) - Bring Docker images into new git repositories
 * [GUACAMOLE-50](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-50) - Update Docker containers to use Java 8


Improved user management
------------------------

Support for role-based access control within LDAP via the standard `seeAlso`
attribute has been added, allowing access to connections to be dictated on a
per-group basis, rather than strictly per-user.

Guacamole's administrative interface has also been mildly enhanced, adding a
convenient "Clone" button for copying users and their associated permissions
(similar to the "Clone" button already available for connections).

 * [GUACAMOLE-12](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-12) - Allow LDAP role-based access control for guacConfigGroups
 * [GUACAMOLE-14](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-14) - Add support for cloning existing users


Absolute concurrency limits
---------------------------

Administrators can now restrict the total number of active connections allowed
by a Guacamole server. Unlike other existing concurrency limits, this limit
ignores connection and user identity; it is a strict absolute limit covering
overall use.

 * [GUACAMOLE-26](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-26) - Add support for overall concurrency limits


Session affinity ("sticky sessions")
------------------------------------

For the cases where balancing groups may route users to any one of several
desktops, and it is important that users are consistently routed to the same
desktop to avoid losing work, administrators can now enable "session affinity"
on those balancing groups. Users of those balancing groups will then be
directed to the same underlying connection until they logout from Guacamole.

 * [GUACAMOLE-53](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-53) - Add support for session affinity within balancing groups


Exposing terminal output to JavaScript
--------------------------------------

Both SSH and telnet now expose raw text output via the Guacamole protocol's
"pipe streams" (essentially named pipes). Though not leveraged by the Guacamole
web application, downstream users of the Guacamole API can grab and handle the
data sent along these streams as they see fit using client-side JavaScript.

 * [GUACAMOLE-17](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-17) - Allow terminal output to be redirected to pipe streams


Miscellaneous bugs
------------------

This latest release of Guacamole also includes fixes for minor usability issues
in IE11, failures to render errors properly under certain circumstances, and
typos in Guacamole's French translation.

 * [GUACAMOLE-10](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-10) - Keyboard focus is permanently lost after clicking the URL bar in IE11
 * [GUACAMOLE-11](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-11) - No error screen during an invalid SSH login in 0.9.8
 * [GUACAMOLE-18](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-18) - Fix typo in French translation
 * [GUACAMOLE-22](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-22) - Update missing french translations
 * [GUACAMOLE-23](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-23) - __guac_socket_fd_select_handler() must always init fd_set
 * [GUACAMOLE-66](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-66) - Remove usage of Apache Commons Codec Library
 * [GUACAMOLE-67](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-67) - I/O error in WebSocket can cause connection tracking to fail
