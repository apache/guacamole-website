The 1.5.0 release features support for in-browser playback of session
recordings, retrieving secrets from key vaults, SSH support for elliptic-curve
cryptography (ECC) keys, and support for authenticating against multiple LDAP
or Active Directory servers. Users also will now automatically receive
notification of users joining a shared connection, including when
administrators join an active connection via the "Active Sessions" screen.

For a full list of all changes in this release, please see the
[changelog](#changelog).

**The 1.5.0 release is compatible with older 1.x components.** You should
upgrade older components to 1.5.0 when possible, however things should continue
to work correctly in the interim:

* Extensions written for older 1.x releases can be used by 1.5.0.
* Components written for the version of the Guacamole protocol used by older
  1.x releases can be used with components of the 1.5.0 release.

Regardless of inter-component compatibility, **there are changes in 1.5.0 which
may affect downstream users of Guacamole's APIs**. Please see the [deprecation
/ compatibility notes](#deprecation--compatibility-notes) section for more
information.


In-application playback of recordings
-------------------------------------
{:#recording-playback}

Guacamole now supports [playback of session recordings directly within the web
application](/doc/1.5.0/gug/recording-playback.html). An extension is provided
that, if installed, defines a standard location and naming convention for
session recordings that allows those recordings to be associated with
connection history entries:

![The Guacamole history UI showing available session recordings.](/doc/1.5.0/gug/_images/history-table-with-recordings.png)

Any user with sufficient permissions to see those
history entries will then be able to directly open the recording in an
in-browser player by clicking a link next to the history entry in the "History"
screen of the administration interface:

![The in-application Guacamole session recording player being used.](/doc/1.5.0/gug/_images/recording-player-in-use.png)

Support for retrieving secrets from key vaults
----------------------------------------------
{:#key-vaults}

Secrets for both connection parameters and properties within
`guacamole.properties` can now be [retrieved from key vaults](/doc/1.5.0/gug/vault.html),
with initial support for [Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM)](https://www.keepersecurity.com/secrets-manager.html){:rel="nofollow"}.
Leveraging parameter tokens, the administrator can [configure connections to
automatically pull secrets like passwords or private keys from the vault](/doc/1.5.0/gug/vault.html#automatic-injection-of-secrets-based-on-connection-parameters)
based on the connection's username, the hostname, or other criteria. Custom
tokens can also be defined for arbitrary secrets in the vault.

Notification when users join a session
--------------------------------------
{:#share-notification}

As of 1.5.0, users of a connection that is shared with other users will receive
a notification when those users join the connection, and will see a counter of
the number of other users currently present in the upper-right corner of the
display:

![Count of current users of shared session, including a notification showing
that "guacadmin" has joined.](/images/session-join-notification.png)

This notification and counter displays both users that have joined due to a
share link and administrators that have joined by clicking on the connection
within the "Active Sessions" screen. Users can at any time hover the mouse over
the counter to see which users are currently present:

![Tooltip showing the current users of a shared session.](/images/shared-session-tooltip.png)

SSH support for ECC keys
------------------------
{:#ecc-keys}

As long as libssh2 1.9.0 or later is installed, Guacamole supports using
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) private keys for SSH and SFTP connections,
including keys in OpenSSH format. This support relies on libssh2's support for
the same capability, so the libssh2 version must be at least 1.9.0. If your
distribution does not provide a libssh2 package that is recent enough, you will
need to either [build libssh2 from source](https://www.libssh2.org/) or [use
the `guacamole/guacd` Docker image](/doc/1.5.0/gug/guacamole-docker.html#running-the-guacd-docker-image).

Multiple LDAP servers
---------------------
{:#multi-ldap}

Guacamole can now consider [multiple LDAP or Active Directory servers for
authentication](/doc/1.5.0/gug/ldap-auth.html#using-multiple-ldap-servers),
attempting to authenticate the user against each defined LDAP server until
authentication is successful or no servers remain.

The specific LDAP server that applies can also be narrowed before trying any
servers at all by using username patterns, if part of the username can
reasonably be used to determine this. An example where this might be the case
would be usernames of the form `DOMAIN\user` or `user@DOMAIN`.

Deprecation / Compatibility notes
=================================

Each 1.x release of Apache Guacamole should be compatible with components of
older 1.x releases. This compatibility is intended at the Guacamole protocol
level and at the extension level, but not necessarily at the API level. This
means:

 * Extensions from older 1.x releases should still work in binary form, but may
   need code changes before their source will build against a newer version of
   guacamole-ext.
 * Software which uses the Guacamole protocol of an older 1.x release should
   still work.
 * Software which uses libguac from an older 1.x release should still work by
   continuing to use the libguac from that release, as newer versions of
   libguac may not be API/ABI compatible. In the case of third-party protocol
   support plugins for guacd, this means that the guacd from that release must
   also be used. Compatibility with respect to libguac is represented by the
   [soname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname).
 * You should update to newer versions where applicable and when possible.

As of 1.5.0, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:


libguac API changes
-------------------

### `name` added to `guac_user_info` structure

A new `name` member has been added to `guac_user_info` to allow
implementations to retrieve the optional human-readable name received during
the connection handshake, affecting the size of this structure.

Additionally, because `guac_user_info` forms a part of `guac_user`, this change
also affects the memory offsets of members of the `guac_user` structure which
follow the `info` member, such as `data` and various instruction handlers.

Downstream usages of libguac which make use of `guac_user` or `guac_user_info`
will need to be rebuilt to ensure that the structure sizes and memory offsets
used are correct.

 * [GUACAMOLE-1293](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-1293) - Alert users when admins connect to their session
