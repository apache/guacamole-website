                    proof-of-concept phase, and needed a real home on the internet, we needed to
                    think of a name to register the project under. </p><p>Several acronyms were toyed with and discarded. We tried anagrams, but all
                    were too wordy and complex. We considered naming the project after a fish or an
                    animal, and after suggesting the guanaco, James Muehlner, a developer of the
                    project, suggested (randomly): "guacamole". </p><p>The name had a nice ring, we weren't embarrassed to use it, and it stuck. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idm139795229029504"></a><a id="idm139795231105616"></a><p><strong>A.2.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>What does "clientless" mean? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The term "clientless" means that no specific client is needed. A Guacamole
                    user needs only have an HTML5 web browser installed, which is exceedingly
                    common; virtually all modern computers and mobile devices have such a browser
                    installed by default. </p><p>In this sense, Guacamole is "clientless" in that it does not require any
                    additional software to be installed beyond what is considered standard for any
                    computer. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idm139795231214608"></a><a id="idm139795231214320"></a><p><strong>A.3.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Does Guacamole use WebSocket? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Guacamole uses either WebSocket or plain HTTP, whichever is supported by both
                    the browser and your servlet container. If WebSocket cannot be used for any
                    reason, Guacamole will fall back to using HTTP.</p><p>Historically, Guacamole had no WebSocket support at all. This was due to a
                    lack of browser support and lack of a true standard. Overall, it didn't matter
                    as there really wasn't any need: the tunnel used by Guacamole when WebSocket is
                    not available is largely equivalent to WebSocket in terms of efficiency and
                    latency, and is more compatible with proxies and existing browsers.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idm139795229436256"></a><a id="idm139795229435968"></a><p><strong>A.4.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>I have Tomcat (or some other servlet container) set up behind a proxy (like

                    will not flush this data in real-time. Each proxy has an option to force
                    flushing of each packet automatically, as this is necessary for streaming
                    applications like Guacamole, but this is usually not enabled by default. </p><p>Because Guacamole depends on streaming to function, a proxy configured to not
                    automatically flush packets will disrupt the stream to the point that the
                    connection seems unreasonably slow, or just fails to establish altogether. </p><p>In the case of mod_proxy, this option is <code class="code">flushpackets=on</code>. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idm139795232135712"></a><a id="idm139795232135424"></a><p><strong>A.5.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>I connect to the internet through a web proxy, and cannot connect to

                    should solve the problem. Proxies are required to stream HTTPS because of the
                    nature of SSL. Using HTTPS will allow Guacamole traffic to stream through
                    proxies unencumbered, even if you cannot access the proxy settings directly. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="idm139795228980960"></a><a id="idm139795228980672"></a><p><strong>A.6.</strong></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Can I buy special licensing of the Guacamole code base, such that I can use it
