        web interface if the underlying authentication module supports this. The only
        officially-supported authentication modules supporting this are the database extensions,
        which are documented in <a class="xref" href="jdbc-auth.html" title="Chapter 6. Database authentication">Chapter 6, <em>Database authentication</em></a>.</p><p>If you are using the default authentication mechanism, or another authentication
        extension, this chapter probably does not apply to you, and the management options will not
        be visible in the Guacamole interface. If, on the other hand, you are using one of the
        database authentication providers, and you are logged in as a user with sufficient
        privileges, you will see management sections listed within the settings screen:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/guacamole-settings-sections.png" width="315" /><div class="caption"><p>Sections within the Guacamole settings screen.</p></div></div></div><p>Clicking any of these options will take you to a corresponding management section where

The session
            management screen displays all active sessions and allows system administrators to kill
            them as needed.</p><p>When any user accesses a particular remote desktop connection, a unique session is
            created and will appear in the list of active sessions in the session management screen.
            Each active session is displayed in a sortable table, showing the corresponding user's
            username, how long the session has been active, the IP address of the machine from which
            the user is connecting, and the name of the connection being used.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/manage-sessions.png" width="450" /><div class="caption"><p>Session management interface</p></div></div></div></div><p>To kill one or more sessions, select the sessions by clicking their checkboxes.

Clicking any column
                will resort the table by the values within that column, while clicking a column
                which is already sorted will toggle between ascending and descending order.</p><p>The content of the table can be limited through search terms specified in the
                "Filter" field. Entering search terms will limit the table to only sessions
                containing those terms. For example, to list only connections by the user
                "guacadmin" which have been active since March, 2015, you would enter: "guacadmin
                2015-03". Beware that if a search term needs to contain spaces, it must be enclosed
                in double quotes to avoid being interpreted as multiple terms.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/session-filter-example-1.png" width="450" /></div></div><p>If you wish to narrow the content of the table to only those connections which
                originate from a particular block of IP addresses, you can do this by specifying the
                block in standard CIDR notation, such "10.0.0.0/8" or "2001:db8:1234::/48". This
                will work with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/session-filter-example-2.png" width="450" /></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="connection-history"></a>Connection history</h2></div></div></div><a id="idm45241639802704" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm45241639801808" class="indexterm"></a><p>Clicking "History" navigates to the connection history screen. The connection history
            screen displays a table of the most recent connections, including the user that used
            that connection, the time the connection began, and how long the connection was
            used.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/manage-history.png" width="450" /><div class="caption"><p>Connection history interface</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="filtering-history"></a>Filtering and sorting</h3></div></div></div><p>Initially, the connection history table will display only the most recent history
                records. You can page through these records to see how and when Guacamole has been
                used.</p><p>Just as with the table of active sessions described earlier, the table of history
                records can be resorted by clicking on the column headers or filtered by entering
                search terms within the "Filter" field.</p><p>The same filtering format applies - a search term containing spaces must be
                enclosed in double quotes to avoid being interpreted as multiple terms, and only
                history records which contain each term will be included in the history table.
                Unlike the table of active sessions, however, the filter will only take effect once
                you click the "Search" button. This is due to the nature of the connection history,
                as the number of records may be quite extensive.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="user-management"></a>User management</h2></div></div></div><a id="idm45241640561936" class="indexterm"></a><p>Clicking "Users" within the list of settings sections will take you to the user

            username. Note that, unless you specify otherwise, the new user will have no access to
            any existing connections, nor any administrative privileges, and you will need to
            manually set the user's password before they will be able to log in.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/manage-users.png" width="450" /><div class="caption"><p>User management interface</p></div></div></div></div><p>To edit a user, just click on the user you wish to edit.

            read access to specific connections, sharing profiles, or groups. If you are managing a
            large number of connections or groups and wish to reduce the size of the list displayed,

            Clicking this button will permanently delete the user. Alternatively, if you only wish
            to temporarily disable the account, checking "Login disabled" will achieve the same

            large number of connections, you can also enter search terms within the "Filter" field
            to filter the list of connections by name or protocol.</p><p>To add a new connection or connection group, click the "New Connection" or "New Group"
            button, or the "New Connection" or "New Group" placeholders which appear when you expand

Each group can
                contain any number of other connections or groups, but the semantics of the group
                change depending on the type.</p><p>An organizational group behaves exactly as a folder or directory in a file system.
                It simply contains connections and other groups, but provides no other behavior.
                Clicking on an organizational group within a connection list will expand the group,
                revealing its contents.</p><p>A balancing group behaves as a connection. It dynamically balances load across the
                connections it contains, choosing the connection with the fewest number of active
                users. Unlike organizational groups, clicking on a balancing group causes a new
                connection to be opened. The actual underlying connection used depends on which
                connection has the least load at the time the group was clicked, and whether session
                affinity is enabled on that group.</p><p><a id="idm45241640225808" class="indexterm"></a>Enabling session affinity for a balancing group ensures that users are
                consistently routed to the same underlying connections until they log out of
                Guacamole. The load balancing behavior of the balancing group will apply only for
                the first time a particular user connects to the group. If your users may lose their
                desktop state if they are routed to a different underlying connection, this option
                should be enabled.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/edit-group.png" width="450" /><div class="caption"><p>Editing a connection group</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm45241640220720"></a>Connection sharing</h3></div></div></div><p>The ability to share a connection is governed through the use of "sharing
                profiles". If a sharing profile is created for a connection, users with access to
                both that connection and that sharing profile will be able to share the connection
                with other users by <a class="link" href="using-guacamole.html#client-share-menu" title="Sharing the connection">generating connection sharing links</a>, even if
                those users do not otherwise have user accounts within Guacamole.</p><p>The name of the sharing profile will be presented an option within the <a class="link" href="using-guacamole.html#client-share-menu" title="Sharing the connection">share
                    menu</a> for any users with access, while the level of access granted to
                users of generated share links will be dictated by the parameters specified for the
                sharing profile.</p><div class="important"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The only extension which ships with Guacamole and implements enough

                    If you wish to share connections (or allow your users to share connections), you

                    need is already provided.</p></div><p>Unlike connections and groups, there is no "New Sharing Profile" button. Sharing
                profiles are created through clicking the "New Sharing Profile" placeholders which
                appear when connections are expanded. Just as expanding a connection group reveals
                the connections or groups therein, expanding a connection reveals the sharing
                profiles associated with that connection. This holds true with both <a class="link" href="administration.html#connection-management" title="Connections and connection groups">the
