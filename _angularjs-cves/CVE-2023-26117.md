title: angular vulnerable to regular expression denial of service via the $resource service
cve:   CVE-2023-26117
---

This is a potential regular expression denial of service in AngularJS'
`$resource` service. This cannot affect Guacamole, which does not make use of
the `$resource` service, let alone pass untrusted data to it.
