title: AngularJS improper sanitization in SVG '<image>' element
cve:   CVE-2025-0716
---

This is a potential bypass of AngularJS' image source restriction capabilities
specific to the `href` and `xlink:href` attributes of `<image>` tags within SVG
content. This cannot affect Guacamole, which does not rely on AngularJS to
restrict image sources.
