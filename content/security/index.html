                <h1>Security Reports</h1>

<p>This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of
Apache Guacamole. Each vulnerability is listed with a description of the
problem, its associated <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#what_is_cve_id">CVE
number</a>, and the
Guacamole release in which the vulnerability was fixed.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-new-vulnerabilities">Reporting new vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>If you believe you have discovered a security problem in Apache Guacamole,
please follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible
disclosure</a> practices and
report discovered security issues privately, either to the private security
mailing list of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/security/">ASF Security Team</a> or
the <a href="mailto:security@guacamole.apache.org">security@guacamole.apache.org</a> mailing list, before disclosing or
discussing the issue in a public forum.</p>

<h2 id="not-affected-by-cve-2021-44228">Is Apache Guacamole affected by CVE-2021-44228?</h2>

<p>No, CVE-2021-44228 does not affect Apache Guacamole. Guacamole uses
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> as its logging backend, not Log4j.</p>

<h2 id="fixed-in-apache-guacamole-152">Fixed in Apache Guacamole 1.5.2</h2>
<ul>
    
        <li>
            <h3 id="CVE-2023-30575">
                Incorrect calculation of Guacamole protocol element lengths

            </h3>
            <p>Apache Guacamole 1.5.1 and older may incorrectly calculate the lengths of
instruction elements sent during the Guacamole protocol handshake, potentially
allowing an attacker to inject Guacamole instructions during the handshake
through specially-crafted data.</p>

            <p>Apache Guacamole 0.9.10 through 1.5.1 may continue to reference a freed RDP

            <p>Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 do not properly validate responses received
from a SAML identity provider. If SAML support is enabled, this may allow a
malicious user to assume the identity of another Guacamole user.</p>

            <p>Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel

connection.</p>

            <p>Apache Guacamole 1.2.0 and older do not consistently restrict access to
connection history based on user visibility. If multiple users share access to
the same connection, those users may be able to see which other users have
accessed that connection, as well as the IP addresses from which that
connection was accessed, even if those users do not otherwise have permission
to see other users.</p>

            <p>Apache Guacamole 1.1.0 and older may mishandle pointers involved in processing

            <p>Prior to 1.0.0, Apache Guacamole used a cookie for client-side storage of the
user’s session token. This cookie lacked the “secure” flag, which could allow
an attacker eavesdropping on the network to intercept the user’s session token
if unencrypted HTTP requests are made to the same domain.</p>

            <p>A race condition in Guacamole’s terminal emulator could allow writes of blocks

beyond the end of a statically-allocated buffer.</p>
