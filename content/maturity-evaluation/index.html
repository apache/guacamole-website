<p>This is an assessment of the Guacamole podling’s maturity, meant to help inform
the decision (of the mentors, community, Incubator PMC and ASF Board of
Directors) to graduate it as a top-level Apache project. It is based on <a href="http://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html">the
ASF project maturity model</a>.</p>

no charge.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> We sure do.</p>

control system, in a reliable way based on strong authentication of the
committer. When third-party contributions are committed, commit messages
provide reliable information about the code provenance.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Commits are accepted only through pull requests <a href="/pull-requests/">after having been
reviewed by other committers</a>, and git inherently records
the name and email address of the author for each commit.</p>

ASF’s own security documentation, which is linked within the project
website’s navigation menu.</p>

document any incompatible changes and provide tools and documentation to help
users transition to new features.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Any changes in a release which affect compatibility are noted in the
release notes. Where possible, old functionality is maintained but
deprecated. See <a href="/0.9.13-incubating/#deprecation--compatibility-notes">the “deprecation / compatibility notes” section of the

  <dt>CO30</dt>
  <dd>Contributions include not only source code, but also documentation,
constructive bug reports, constructive discussions, marketing and generally
anything that adds value to the project.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Participation within the mailing lists and JIRA is active and
encouraged. The community can contribute to the documentation and website
just as they can contribute to the code of the project.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CO40</dt>
  <dd>The community is meritocratic and over time aims to give more rights and
responsibilities to contributors who add value to the project.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> The community’s meritocratic nature is <a href="/open-source/#meritocracy">documented on the project
website</a>. Through operating in this fashion, the
project has grown over the course of its incubation from its original two
committers to five.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CO50</dt>
  <dd>The way in which contributors can be granted more rights such as commit
access or decision power is clearly documented and is the same for all
contributors.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> See CO40.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CO60</dt>
  <dd>The community operates based on consensus of its members (see CS10) who have
decision power. Dictators, benevolent or not, are not welcome in Apache
projects.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Decisions affecting the project are made only on the mailing lists
through discussions and VOTEs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CO70</dt>
  <dd>The project strives to answer user questions in a timely manner.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Yes, via the mailing lists.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="consensus-building">Consensus Building</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>CS10</dt>
  <dd>The project maintains a public list of its contributors who have decision
power – the project’s PMC (Project Management Committee) consists of those
contributors.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> This list is automatically produced by people.apache.org and can be
found at: <a href="http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#guacamole">http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#guacamole</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CS20</dt>
  <dd>Decisions are made by consensus among PMC members and are documented on the
project’s main communications channel. Community opinions are taken into
account but the PMC has the final word if needed.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> All decisions affecting the project are made on the mailing lists
(see CO60) and are inherently documented through the mail archives.
Development itself is documented in JIRA.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CS30</dt>
  <dd>Documented voting rules are used to build consensus when discussion is not
sufficient.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Discussion has always been sufficient. If/when consensus cannot be
reached via discussion, voting is the next logical step.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CS40</dt>
  <dd>In Apache projects, vetoes are only valid for code commits and are justified
by a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> The project has never used vetoes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CS50</dt>
  <dd>All “important” discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the
project’s main communications channel. Offline, face-to-face or private
discussions that affect the project are also documented on that channel.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> All decisions affecting the project are made on the mailing lists
(see CO60).</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="independence">Independence</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>IN10</dt>
  <dd>The project is independent from any corporate or organizational influence.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> Project members operate as individuals, not representatives of any
organization (corporate or otherwise). Though the project members were
originally all affiliated with the same organization, the project has grown
and this is no longer the case (see CO40).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>IN20</dt>
  <dd>Contributors act as themselves as opposed to representatives of a corporation
or organization.

    <p><strong>OK:</strong> See IN10.</p>
