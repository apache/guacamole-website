        <!-- Content -->
        <div class="readable-content">
            <p>If you need (or wish to provide) help with Guacamole, the primary means for
doing so are the project <a href="#mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>. All project members
subscribe to these lists, and members of the community are encouraged to do the
same.</p>

<p>We also consider the availability of commercial support to be crucial to the
success of Apache Guacamole, and thus maintain <a href="#commercial-support">a list of third party
companies providing commercial support</a>. If you represent
a company that provides commercial support for Apache Guacamole, you may also
<a href="#requesting-to-be-listed">request to be listed here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mailing-lists">Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>Like all other projects under Apache or the Apache Incubator, mailing lists
form Guacamole’s primary support channel and the means by which development
is coordinated.</p>

<p>If you would like help with Apache Guacamole, or wish to help others, we highly
recommend sending an email to the one of the project’s mailing lists. <strong>You
will need to subscribe prior to sending email to any list.</strong> All mailing lists
are actively filtered for spam, and any email not originating from a subscriber
will bounce.</p>

<div class="note">
    <p>Before posting to any Apache Guacamole mailing list, please remember to
be respectful and considerate of the community that subscribes to that
list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abide by <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">the ASF's Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> send unsolicited messages advertising a product or service.</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> use the mailing lists to promote proprietary enhancements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The announcements list is a low traffic list that strictly receives project
announcements. These announcements include new releases as well as security
advisories. Only project members can post to the announcements list.</p>

<h2 id="the-guacamole-manual"><a href="/doc/gug/">The Guacamole Manual</a></h2>

<p>The central body of documentation is the <a href="/doc/gug/">Guacamole manual</a>. It is kept up-to-date with each release, and provides a massive amount of information in one place. The manual contains installation and configuration instructions, as well as instructions for using the application itself. There is also a large section devoted entirely to development tutorials and descriptions of the architecture and APIs of the Guacamole core.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-support">Commercial Support</h2>

<p>As some of the main target audiences for Apache Guacamole are enterprises and
companies that need to provide access to many computers (hence its design as a
gateway), we consider the availability of commercial support crucial to
Guacamole’s success. The companies listed below have requested to be listed as
commercial support providers. If you represent a company that provides
commercial support for Apache Guacamole, you may also <a href="#requesting-to-be-listed">request to be listed
here</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
    <p>Companies providing support for Apache Guacamole are <strong>not
endorsed nor vetted</strong> by the Apache Software Foundation, though some
such companies do employ committers of the Apache Guacamole project. The links,
