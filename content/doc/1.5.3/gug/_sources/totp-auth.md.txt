TOTP two-factor authentication
==============================

Guacamole supports TOTP as a second authentication factor, layered on top of
any other authentication extension, including those available from the main
project website, providing [base requirements for key storage and
enrollment](totp-prerequisites) are met. The TOTP authentication extension
allows users to be additionally verified against a user-specific and secret key
generated during [enrollment of their authentication device](totp-enrollment).

:::{important}
This chapter involves modifying the contents of `GUACAMOLE_HOME` - the
Guacamole configuration directory. If you are unsure where `GUACAMOLE_HOME` is
located on your system, please consult [](configuring-guacamole) before
proceeding.

(totp-prerequisites)=

Prerequisites
-------------

The enrollment process used by Guacamole's TOTP support needs to be able
to store an automatically-generated key within the user's account.
Another extension must be installed which supports storage of arbitrary
data from other extensions. *Currently the only extensions provided with
Guacamole which support this kind of storage are the [database
authentication extensions](jdbc-auth).*

It is thus recommended that authentication against a database be fully
configured prior to setting up TOTP. Instructions walking through the setup of
database authentication for Guacamole are provided in [](jdbc-auth).

How TOTP works with Guacamole
-----------------------------

Guacamole provides support for TOTP as a second authentication factor.  To make
use of the TOTP authentication extension, some other authentication mechanism
will need be configured, as well. When a user attempts to log into Guacamole,
other installed authentication methods will be queried first:

Only after authentication has succeeded with one of those methods will
Guacamole prompt the user to further verify their identity with an
authentication code:

![](images/totp-auth-factor-2.png)

If both the initial authentication attempt and verification using TOTP succeed,
the user will be allowed in. If either mechanism fails, access to Guacamole is
denied.

(totp-enrollment)=

### Enrollment

If the user does not yet have a TOTP key associated with their account (they
have not yet completed enrollment), they will be required to enroll an
authentication device after passing the first authentication factor. A QR code
containing an automatically-generated key will be presented to the user to be
scanned by their authentication app or device:

![](images/totp-enroll.png)

If the authentication device does not support scanning QR codes for enrollment,
the details within the QR code can be revealed by clicking the "Show" link next
to the "Details" header. These values can then be entered manually:

![](images/totp-enroll-detail.png)

Enrollment is completed once the user enters a valid authentication code
generated by their device using the provided key.

(totp-reset-data)=

### Reseting TOTP Data

It may become necessary for certain users to clear their TOTP key and/or force
them to re-confirm enrollment, such as in situations where a user loses their
phone and needs to reconfigure TOTP. The user's existing TOTP key can be cleared
by checking the "Clear TOTP secret" box in the user interface and then saving the
user configuration. The next time that the user logs in, they will be given a new
key (QR code) and forced to re-enroll.

If you simply want a user to be able to re-configure an existing key, without
resetting the secret, you can un-check the box marked "TOTP key confirmed" and
save the user configuration, and the user will be presented with the QR code
at next login and asked to confirm it.

Downloading the TOTP extension
------------------------------

The TOTP authentication extension is available separately from the main
`guacamole.war`. The link for this and all other officially-supported and
compatible extensions for a particular version of Guacamole are provided on the
release notes for that version. You can find the release notes for current
versions of Guacamole here: <http://guacamole.apache.org/releases/>.

The TOTP authentication extension is packaged as a `.tar.gz` file containing
only the extension itself, `guacamole-auth-totp-1.5.3.jar`, which must
ultimately be placed in `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions`.

(installing-totp-auth)=

Installing TOTP authentication
------------------------------

Guacamole extensions are self-contained `.jar` files which are located within
the `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions` directory. To install the TOTP authentication
extension, you must:

1. Create the `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions` directory, if it does not already
   exist.

2. Copy `guacamole-auth-totp-1.5.3.jar` within `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions`.

3. Configure Guacamole to use TOTP authentication, as described below.

:::{important}
You will need to restart Guacamole by restarting your servlet container in
order to complete the installation. Doing this will disconnect all active
users, so be sure that it is safe to do so prior to attempting installation. If
you do not configure the TOTP authentication properly, Guacamole will not start
up again until the configuration is fixed.

(guac-totp-config)=

### Configuring Guacamole for TOTP

With the exception of [the storage and permission requirements described
above](totp-prerequisites), the TOTP extension should work out-of-the-box
without any additional configuration. Defaults have been chosen for all
configuration parameters such that the TOTP extension will be compatible with
Google Authenticator and similar, popular TOTP implementations.

If your intended authentication application or device has different
requirements, or you wish to override the defaults, additional properties may
be specified within `guacamole.properties`:

`totp-issuer`
: The human-readable name of the entity issuing user accounts. If not
  specified, "Apache Guacamole" will be used by default.

`totp-digits`
: The number of digits which should be included in each generated TOTP code.
  Legal values are 6, 7, or 8. By default, 6-digit codes are generated.

`totp-period`
: The duration that each generated code should remain valid, in seconds. By
  default, each code remains valid for 30 seconds.

`totp-mode`
: The hash algorithm that should be used to generate TOTP codes. Legal values
  are "sha1", "sha256", and "sha512". By default, "sha1" is used.

(completing-totp-install)=

### Completing the installation

Guacamole will only reread `guacamole.properties` and load newly-installed
extensions during startup, so your servlet container will need to be restarted
before TOTP authentication will take effect.  Restart your servlet container
and give the new authentication a try.

:::{important}
You only need to restart your servlet container. *You do not need to restart
guacd*.

guacd is completely independent of the web application and does not deal with
`guacamole.properties` or the authentication system in any way. Since you are
already restarting the servlet container, restarting guacd as well technically
won't hurt anything, but doing so is completely pointless.
:::

If Guacamole does not come back online after restarting your servlet container,
check the logs. Problems in the configuration of the TOTP extension may prevent
Guacamole from starting up, and any such errors will be recorded in the logs of
your servlet container.
