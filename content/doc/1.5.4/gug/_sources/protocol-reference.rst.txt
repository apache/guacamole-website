.. guac:instruction:: arc
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: interactive

    The arc instruction adds the specified arc subpath to the existing path,
    creating a new path if no path exists. The path created can be modified further
    by other path-type instructions, and finally stroked, filled, and/or closed.

        The index of the stream along which the given data should be sent.

    :arg string data:
        The base64-encoded data to send.

.. guac:instruction:: file
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    messages is intentionally broad and flexible - the message must include
    a numeric code that the client understands and can act on, and may also
    any number of arguments that can be used by the client in association
    with the message.

    :arg integer msg:
        A numeric value indicating the message that is being passed to the client.

    :arg string args:

    :phase: interactive

    Allocates a new stream, associating it with the given arbitrary named pipe
    metadata. The contents of the pipe will later be sent along the stream with
    blob instructions. Pipes in the Guacamole protocol are unidirectional,
    named pipes, very similar to a UNIX FIFO or pipe. It is up to client-side
    code to handle pipe data appropriately, likely based upon the name of the
    pipe, which is arbitrary. Pipes may be opened by either the client or the
    server.

    :arg integer layer:
        The index of the layer to stream the video data into. The effect of
        other drawing operations on this layer during playback is undefined,
        as the client codec implementation may leverage any rendering
        mechanism it sees fit, including hardware decoding.

    :arg string mimetype:
        The mimetype of the video data being sent.

    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    Allocates a new stream, associating it with the name of a stream previously
    requested by a get instruction. The contents of the stream will be sent
    later with blob instructions. The full size of the stream need not be known
    ahead of time.

    :arg integer object:
        The index of the object associated with this stream.

    :arg integer stream:
        The index of the stream to allocate.

    :arg string mimetype:
        The mimetype of the data being sent.

    :arg string name:
        The name of the stream associated with the object.

.. guac:instruction:: filesystem
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: interactive

    Allocates a new object, associating it with the given arbitrary filesystem
    metadata. The contents of files and directories within the filesystem will
    later be sent along streams requested with get instructions or created with
    put instructions.

    :arg integer object:
        The index of the object to allocate.

    :arg string name:
        The name of the filesystem.

.. guac:instruction:: get
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    Requests that a new stream be created, providing read access to the object
    stream having the given name. The requested stream will be created, in
    response, with a body instruction.

    Stream names are arbitrary and dictated by the object from which they are
    requested, with the exception of the root stream of the object itself,
    which has the reserved name "``/``". The root stream of the object has the
    mimetype "``application/vnd.glyptodon.guacamole.stream-index+json``", and
    provides a simple JSON map of available stream names to their corresponding
    mimetypes. If the object contains a hierarchy of streams, some of these
    streams may also be
    "``application/vnd.glyptodon.guacamole.stream-index+json``".

    For example, the ultimate content of the body stream provided in response
    to a get request for the root stream of an object containing two text
    streams, "A" and "B", would be the following:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
          "A" : "text/plain",
          "B" : "text/plain"
        }

    :arg integer object:
        The index of the object to request a stream from.

    :arg string name:
        The name of the stream being requested from the given object.

.. guac:instruction:: put
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    Allocates a new stream, associating it with the given arbitrary object and
    stream name. The contents of the stream will later be sent with blob
    instructions.

    :arg integer object:
        The index of the object associated with this stream.

    :arg integer stream:
        The index of the stream to allocate.

    :arg string mimetype:
        The mimetype of the data being sent.

    :arg string name:
        The name of the stream within the given object to which data is being
        sent.

.. guac:instruction:: undefine
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    Undefines an existing object, allowing its index to be reused by another
    future object. The resource associated with the original object may or may
    not continue to exist - it simply no longer has an associated object.

    :arg integer object:
        The index of the object to undefine.

Client handshake instructions
-----------------------------

.. guac:instruction:: audio
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Specifies which audio mimetypes are supported by the client. Each parameter
    must be a single mimetype, listed in order of client preference, with the
    optimal mimetype being the first parameter.

.. guac:instruction:: connect
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Begins the connection using the previously specified protocol with the
    given arguments. This is the last instruction sent during the handshake
    phase.

    The parameters of this instruction correspond exactly to the parameters of
    the received args instruction. If the received args instruction has, for
    example, three parameters, the responding connect instruction must also
    have three parameters.

.. guac:instruction:: image
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Specifies which image mimetypes are supported by the client. Each parameter
    must be a single mimetype, listed in order of client preference, with the
    optimal mimetype being the first parameter.

    It is expected that the supported mimetypes will include at least
    "image/png" and "image/jpeg", and the server *may* safely assume that these
    mimetypes are supported, even if they are absent from the handshake.

.. guac:instruction:: name
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake

    Specifies the human-readable name of the user joining a connection. A
    single, string value is expected for this, and guacd does not expect
    or require that this value be unique among other users connected to
    the server or connection. The type of name provided is completely up
    to the client implementation.

.. guac:instruction:: select
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Requests that the connection be made using the specified protocol, or to
    the specified existing connection. Whether a new connection is established
    or an existing connection is joined depends on whether the ID of an active
    connection is provided. The Guacamole protocol dictates that the IDs
    generated for active connections (provided during the handshake of those
    connections via the `ready instruction <#ready-instruction>`__) must not
    collide with any supported protocols.

    This is the first instruction sent during the handshake phase.

    :arg string identifier:
        The name of the protocol to use, such as "vnc" or "rdp", or the ID of
        the active connection to be joined, as returned via the `ready
        instruction <#ready-instruction>`__.

.. guac:instruction:: size
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Specifies the client's optimal screen size and resolution.

    :arg integer width:
        The optimal screen width.

    :arg integer height:
        The optimal screen height.

    :arg integer dpi:
        The optimal screen resolution, in approximate DPI.

.. guac:instruction:: timezone
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Specifies the timezone of the client system, in IANA zone key format.  This
    is a single-value parameter, and may be used by protocols to set the
    timezone on the remote computer, if the remote system allows the timezone
    to be configured. This instruction is optional.

    :arg string timezone:

.. guac:instruction:: video
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: handshake 

    Specifies which video mimetypes are supported by the client. Each parameter
    must be a single mimetype, listed in order of client preference, with the
    optimal mimetype being the first parameter.

Server handshake instructions
-----------------------------

.. guac:instruction:: args
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: handshake 

    Reports the expected format of the argument list for the protocol requested
    by the client. This message can be sent by the server during the handshake
    phase only.

    The first parameter of this instruction will be the protocol version
    supported by the server. This is used to negotiate protocol compatibility
    between the client and the server, with the highest supported protocol by
    both sides being chosen. Versions of Guacamole prior to 1.1.0 do not
    support protocol version negotiation, and will silently ignore this
    instruction.

    The remaining parameters of the args instruction are the names of all
    connection parameters accepted by the server for the protocol selected by
    the client, in order. The client's responding connect instruction must
    contain the values of each of these parameters in the same order.

Control instructions
--------------------

.. guac:instruction:: disconnect
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: handshake,interactive

    Notifies the client or server that the connection is about to be closed.
    This message can be sent during any phase, and takes no parameters.

.. guac:instruction:: nop
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    The "nop" instruction does absolutely nothing, has no parameters, and is
    universally ignored by both Guacamole clients and servers. Its main use is
    as a keep-alive signal, and may be sent by guacd, client plugins, or web
    applications when there is no activity to ensure the socket is not closed
    due to timeout.

.. guac:instruction:: sync
    :sent-by: client,server
    :phase: interactive

    Reports that all operations as of the given server-relative timestamp have
    been completed. Both client and server are expected to occasionally send
    sync to report on current operation execution state, with the server using
    sync to denote the end of a logical frame.
    
    If a sync is received from the server, the client must respond with a
    corresponding sync once all previous operations have been completed, or the
    server may stop sending updates until the client catches up. For the
    client, sending a sync with a timestamp newer than any timestamp received
    from the server is an error.

    :arg integer timestamp:
        A valid server-relative timestamp.

Server control instructions
---------------------------

.. guac:instruction:: error
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: handshake,interactive

    Notifies the client that the connection is about to be closed due to the
    specified error. This message can be sent by the server during any phase.

    :arg string message:
        An arbitrary message describing the error

    :arg integer status:
        The Guacamole status code describing the error. For a list of status
        codes, see the table in `Status codes <#status-codes>`__.

.. guac:instruction:: log
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: interactive

    The log instruction sends an arbitrary string for debugging purposes.  This
    instruction will be ignored by Guacamole clients, but can be seen in
    protocol dumps if such dumps become necessary. Sending a log instruction
    can help add context when searching for the cause of a fault in protocol
    support.

    :arg string message:
        An arbitrary, human-readable message.

.. guac:instruction:: mouse
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: interactive

    Reports that a user on the current connection has moved the mouse to the
    given coordinates.

    :arg integer x:
        The current X coordinate of the mouse pointer.

    :arg integer y:
        The current Y coordinate of the mouse pointer.

.. guac:instruction:: ready
    :sent-by: server
    :phase: handshake

    The ready instruction sends the ID of a new connection and marks the
    beginning of the interactive phase of a new, successful connection. The ID
    sent is a completely arbitrary string, and has no standard format. It must
    be unique from all existing and future connections and may not match the
    name of any installed protocol support.

    :arg string identifier:
        An arbitrary, unique identifier for the current connection. This
        identifier must be unique from all existing and future connections,
        and may not match the name of any installed protocol support (such as
        "vnc" or "rdp").

Input/Event instructions
------------------------

.. guac:instruction:: key
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: interactive

    Sends the specified key press or release event.

    :arg integer keysym:
        The `X11 keysym <https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#keysym_encoding>`__ of the key being
        pressed or released.

    :arg integer pressed:
        0 if the key is not pressed, 1 if the key is pressed.

.. guac:instruction:: mouse
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: interactive

    Sends the specified mouse movement or button press or release event (or
    combination thereof).

    :arg integer x:
        The current X coordinate of the mouse pointer.

    :arg integer y:
        The current Y coordinate of the mouse pointer.

    :arg integer mask:
        The button mask, representing the pressed or released status of each
        mouse button.

.. guac:instruction:: size
    :sent-by: client
    :phase: interactive

    Specifies that the client's optimal screen size has changed from what was
    specified during the handshake, or from previously-sent "size"
    instructions.

    :arg integer width:
        The new, optimal screen width.

    :arg integer height:
        The new, optimal screen height.

Status codes
------------

Several Guacamole instructions, and various other internals of the Guacamole
core, use a common set of numeric status codes. These codes denote success or
failure of operations, and can be rendered by user interfaces in a
human-readable way.

0 (``SUCCESS``)
    The operation succeeded. No error.

256 (``UNSUPPORTED``)
    The requested operation is unsupported.

512 (``SERVER_ERROR``)
    An internal error occurred, and the operation could not be performed.

513 (``SERVER_BUSY``)
    The operation could not be performed because the server is busy.

514 (``UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT``)
    The upstream server is not responding. In most cases, the upstream server
    is the remote desktop server.

515 (``UPSTREAM_ERROR``)
    The upstream server encountered an error. In most cases, the upstream
    server is the remote desktop server.

516 (``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``)
    An associated resource, such as a file or stream, could not be found, and
    thus the operation failed.

517 (``RESOURCE_CONFLICT``)
    A resource is already in use or locked, preventing the requested operation.

518 (``RESOURCE_CLOSED``)
    The requested operation cannot continue because the associated resource has
    been closed.

519 (``UPSTREAM_NOT_FOUND``)
    The upstream server does not appear to exist, or cannot be reached over the
    network. In most cases, the upstream server is the remote desktop server.

520 (``UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE``)
    The upstream server is refusing to service connections. In most cases, the
    upstream server is the remote desktop server.

521 (``SESSION_CONFLICT``)
    The session within the upstream server has ended because it conflicts with
    another session. In most cases, the upstream server is the remote desktop
    server.

522 (``SESSION_TIMEOUT``)
    The session within the upstream server has ended because it appeared to be
    inactive. In most cases, the upstream server is the remote desktop server.

523 (``SESSION_CLOSED``)
    The session within the upstream server has been forcibly closed. In most
    cases, the upstream server is the remote desktop server.

768 (``CLIENT_BAD_REQUEST``)
    The parameters of the request are illegal or otherwise invalid.

769 (``CLIENT_UNAUTHORIZED``)
    Permission was denied, because the user is not logged in. Note that the
    user may be logged into Guacamole, but still not logged in with respect to
    the remote desktop server.

771 (``CLIENT_FORBIDDEN``)
    Permission was denied, and logging in will not solve the problem.

776 (``CLIENT_TIMEOUT``)
    The client (usually the user of Guacamole or their browser) is taking too
    long to respond.

781 (``CLIENT_OVERRUN``)
    The client has sent more data than the protocol allows.

783 (``CLIENT_BAD_TYPE``)
    The client has sent data of an unexpected or illegal type.

797 (``CLIENT_TOO_MANY``)
    The client is already using too many resources. Existing resources must be
    freed before further requests are allowed.

Message Codes
-------------

The `msg` instruction must have at least one numeric argument that the client
then uses to interpret the message and determine what action, if any, it
should take based on the message. The following numeric codes are currently
implemented for this instruction.

1 (``USER_JOINED``)
    Notifies the owner of a connection that another user has joined the
    connection. This message is expected to include two additional
    arguments: the guacd-generated UUID of the user who is joining the
    connection, and the arbitrary name of the user provided by the
    client during the handshake.

2 (``USER_LEFT``)
    Notifies the owner of a connection that another user has left the
    connection. This message is expected to include two additional
    arguments: the guacd-generated UUID of the user who is leaving the
    connection, and the arbitrary name of the user provided by the
    client during the handshake.
