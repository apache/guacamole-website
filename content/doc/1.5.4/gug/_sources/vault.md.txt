Retrieving secrets from a vault
===============================

Guacamole supports reading secrets such as connection-specific passwords from a
key vault, automatically injecting those secrets into connection configurations
using [parameter tokens](parameter-tokens) or Guacamole configuration
properties via an additional, vault-specific configuration file analogous to
`guacamole.properties`. This support is intended with multiple vault providers
in mind and currently supports [Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM)](https://www.keepersecurity.com/secrets-manager.html).

:::{important}
This chapter involves modifying the contents of `GUACAMOLE_HOME` - the
Guacamole configuration directory. If you are unsure where `GUACAMOLE_HOME` is
located on your system, please consult [](configuring-guacamole) before
proceeding.

Downloading the vault extension
-------------------------------

The vault extension is available separately from the main `guacamole.war`. The
link for this and all other officially-supported and compatible extensions for
a particular version of Guacamole are provided on the release notes for that
version. You can find the release notes for current versions of Guacamole here:
<http://guacamole.apache.org/releases/>.

The vault extension is packaged as a `.tar.gz` file containing directories
specific to vault implementations (currently only `ksm/` for the KSM
implementation). Each vault-specific directory contains a `.jar` file (the
actual Guacamole extension). The Guacamole extension `.jar` will ultimately
need to be placed within `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions`.

(installing-vault-support)=

Installing key vault support
----------------------------

Guacamole extensions are self-contained `.jar` files which are located within
the `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions` directory. To install the KSM vault extension,
you must:

1. Create the `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions` directory, if it does not already
   exist.

2. Copy `ksm/guacamole-vault-ksm-1.5.4.jar` within `GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions`.

3. Configure Guacamole to use KSM to retrieve secrets, as described below.

:::{important}
You will need to restart Guacamole by restarting your servlet container in
order to complete the installation. Doing this will disconnect all active
users, so be sure that it is safe to do so prior to attempting installation. If
you do not configure the vault support properly, Guacamole will not start up
again until the configuration is fixed.

### Adding Guacamole to KSM

Allowing an application like Guacamole to access secrets via KSM involves
creating an application in KSM. A KSM application is simply a means of
assigning permissions, narrowing exactly which secrets the application in
question should be able to access.

1. Log into your vault via the Keeper Security website and create at least one
   shared folder to house any secrets that should be made available to Apache
   Guacamole. These folders will be used when registering Apache Guacamole with
   KSM and functions to define exactly which secrets the application may access.
   **Secrets that are not within these shared folders will not be accessible by
   Guacamole.**

   The option for creating a shared folder is within a submenu that appears
   when you click on "Create New":

   ![Submenu for creating new objects, including shared folders.](images/vault-ksm-001a-create-shared-folder.png)

   No special options need to be selected for the shared folder except for
   providing a reasonable name for the folder:

   ![Shared folder creation dialog.](images/vault-ksm-001b-create-shared-folder.png)

2. Navigate to KSM by selecting the "Secrets Manager" tab in the navigation
   sidebar on the left side of the screen:

   !["Secrets Manager" selected within the navigation sidebar.](images/vault-ksm-002-select-ksm.png)

3. Click "Create Application" on the right ride of the toolbar near the top of
   the screen:

   !["Create Application" button in the KSM toolbar.](images/vault-ksm-003a-create-application.png)

   The dialog that appears will prompt you to provide a name for the
   application that will access the vault, as well as the shared folder(s) that
   this application will have access to. Enter a reasonable name for the
   application, such as "Apache Guacamole", and select the shared folder(s) you
   created for Guacamole to access:

   ![KSM application creation dialog.](images/vault-ksm-003b-create-application.png)

   Guacamole only needs read-only access permissions to secrets, which should
   already be selected by default.

   :::{warning}
   You should only check the "Lock external WAN IP" box if your Guacamole
   server has a static IP _and_ you will be using the KSM CLI tool directly on
   that server. **If you will be running the KSM CLI tool on a separate machine
   with a different public IP address, you must not check this box.**
   :::

4. Once satisfied with the application name and parameters, click "Generate
   Token" to generate a one-time token:

   ![Application creation confirmation dialog showing the generated one-time token.](images/vault-ksm-004-generate-token.png)

5. Copy the provided one-time token using [the KSM CLI tool](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-command-line-interface/init-command)
   to obtain the base64-encoded configuration that must be provided to
   Guacamole with [the `ksm-config` property](guac-vault-config). **This token
   can only be used once, but the base64 configuration can be used indefinitely
   unless manually revoked within KSM:**

   ```console
   $ ./ksm init default US:_-L2NIxWdMatbyYwBnYROLlJVjeg4BzO3xZWoiDkh4U

   ewogICJjbGllbnRJZCI6ICJTR1ZzYkc4Z2RHaGxjbVVoSUZSb1pYTmxJSEJ5YjNCbGNuUnBaWE1n

   $   
   ```

(guac-vault-config)=

### Configuring Guacamole for KSM

Guacamole requires only a single configuration property to configure secret
retrieval from KSM, `ksm-config`, which must be provided the base64
configuration value retrieved from KSM using the one-time token [obtained when
Guacamole was registered with KSM as an application as described above](adding-guac-to-ksm).
All other configuration properties are optional.

`ksm-config`
: The base64-encoded configuration information generated for the application
  you created within KSM to represent Apache Guacamole. The easiest way to
  obtain this value is using [the KSM CLI tool](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-command-line-interface/init-command).
  as described above. *This value is required.*

`ksm-allow-unverified-cert`
: Whether unverified server certificates should be accepted. If set to `true`,
  the server certificate for connections to the KSM service will be accepted even
  if they cannot be verified. **Unless you are a developer testing changes to
  the KSM vault support itself, it is unlikely that you need to set this
  property.**

(completing-vault-install)=

### Completing the installation

Guacamole will only reread `guacamole.properties` and load newly-installed
extensions during startup, so your servlet container will need to be restarted
before the newly-installed vault support will take effect. Restart your servlet
container and give the vault support a try.

:::{important}
You only need to restart your servlet container. *You do not need to restart
guacd*.

guacd is completely independent of the web application and does not deal with
`guacamole.properties` or the authentication system in any way. Since you are
already restarting the servlet container, restarting guacd as well technically
won't hurt anything, but doing so is completely pointless.
:::

If Guacamole does not come back online after restarting your servlet container,
check the logs. Problems in the configuration of installed vault support
extensions may prevent Guacamole from starting up, and any such errors will be
recorded in the logs of your servlet container.

(vault-connection-secrets)=

Retrieving connection secrets from a vault
------------------------------------------

Secrets for connection parameters are provided using [parameter
tokens](parameter-tokens) that can be either automatically or manually defined.
Automatic tokens are [defined dynamically by Guacamole when the connection is
used](vault-dynamic-secrets) based on other configuration values within the
connection, such as the connection's `hostname` or `username`. Manual tokens
are injected by Guacamole based on secrets that are [statically mapped using an
additional configuration file](vault-static-secrets).

(vault-dynamic-secrets)=

### Automatic injection of secrets based on connection parameters

Parameter tokens containing the values of secrets within a record are
automatically injected for connections whose parameter values match specific
criteria, such as having a particular `username` or `hostname`. This happens
whenever a connection is used and is fully dynamic, affecting only the state of
the connection from the perspective of the user accessing it.

:::{important}
There are limitations to the degree that secrets can be automatically applied
based on connection parameters:

* In all cases, only unique records are considered. If multiple records match
  the criteria that applies to a particular token in the context of a
  connection, the token will not be injected for that connection.

* Automatic injection of secrets cannot currently be used with balancing
  connection groups, as the underlying connection that the balancing
  implementation will choose cannot be known before token values must be made
  available.

If automatic injection of secrets cannot work for your use case, consider using
[manually-specified secrets via `ksm-token-mapping.yml`](vault-static-secrets).
:::

Parameter tokens injected from KSM records take the form
{samp}`$\{KEEPER_{CRITERIA}_{SECRET}\}`, where `CRITERIA` determines how the
applicable record is located based on the connection's parameters and `SECRET`
determines what value is retrieved from that record.

The following `CRITERIA` names are supported:

`USER`
: The record whose "login" field contains a username that matches the value of
  the `username` parameter of the connection. If the record has no "login" field,
  a "text" or "password" custom field will be used if the label of that field
  contains the word "username" (case-insensitive).

`SERVER`
: The record whose "login" field contains a hostname that matches the value of
  the `hostname` parameter of the connection. If the record has no "login" field,
  a "text" or "password" custom field will be used if the label of that field
  contains the word "hostname", "address", or "IP address" (case-insensitive,
  ignoring any spaces between "IP" and "address").

`GATEWAY`
: Identical to `SERVER`, except that the value of the `gateway-hostname`
  parameter is used. This is only applicable to RDP connections.

`GATEWAY_USER`
: Identical to `USER`, except that the value of the `gateway-username`
  parameter is used. This is only applicable to RDP connections.

The following `SECRET` types are supported:

`USERNAME`
: The username specified by the record's "login" field. If the field is a
  custom field, the label must contain the word "username" (case-insensitive)
  and must be a "text" or "hidden" field.

`PASSWORD`
: The password specified by the record's "password" or "hidden" field. If the
  field is a custom field, the label must contain the word "password"
  (case-insensitive).

`KEY`
: The private key associated with the record. If the record has a dedicated
  key pair field, the private key from this field is used. If not, and the
  record has a single `.pem` file attached, the content of that attachment is
  used. Lacking any key pair field or attachment, any custom field that is a
  "password" or "hidden" field will be used as long as it contains the phrase
  "private key" in its label (case-insensitive, ignoring any space(s) between
  "private" and "key").

`PASSPHRASE`
: The passphrase associated with the record's private key, if the record type
  has dedicated fields for these. If the record has no dedicated passphrase
  field, a "password" or "hidden" custom field will be used as long as it
  has the word "passphrase" in its label (case-insensitive).

For example, the `${KEEPER_USER_PASSWORD}` token would retrieve the password
for the user specified by the `username` parameter, and `${KEEPER_SERVER_KEY}`
would retrieve the private key for the server specified by the `hostname`
parameter.

(vault-static-secrets)=

### Manual definition of secrets

Parameter tokens can be manually defined by placing a YAML file within
`GUACAMOLE_HOME` called `ksm-token-mapping.yml`. This file must contain a set
of name/value pairs where each name is the name of a token to define and each
value is [a reference to a secret in KSM using "Keeper Notation"](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/keeper-notation).

For example, the following `ksm-token-mapping.yml` defines two parameter
tokens, `${WINDOWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD}` and `${LINUX_SERVER_KEY}`, each pulling
their values from different parts of different records in KSM:

```yaml
WINDOWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: keeper://odei1zeejoL7Ceiv3eig0a/field/password
LINUX_SERVER_KEY: keeper://Chah0VuPh0ohyeuL4che1o/file/idrsa.pem
```

Token substitution of other parameter tokens like `${GUAC_USERNAME}` is
performed *on the reference to the secret* to allow the reference to vary by
values that may be relevant to the connection. The values of substituted tokens
are URL-encoded before being placed into the reference in "Keeper Notation". In
addition, the following tokens are available for use within the secret
reference:

`${CONNECTION_GROUP_NAME}`
: The human-readable name of the connection group being used. Secrets using
  this token are only available if a user is directly connecting to a balancing
  connection group, not manually connecting to a connection within a group.

`${CONNECTION_GROUP_ID}`
: The unique identifier of the connection group being used. Secrets using this
  token are only available if a user is directly connecting to a balancing
  connection group, not manually connecting to a connection within a group.

`${CONNECTION_NAME}`
: The human-readable name of the connection being used. Secrets using this
  token are only available if a user is directly connecting to a connection, not
  connecting via a balancing group.

`${CONNECTION_ID}`
: The unique identifier of the connection being used. Secrets using this token
  are only available if a user is directly connecting to a connection, not
  connecting via a balancing group.

`${CONNECTION_HOSTNAME}`
: The value of the `hostname` parameter of the connection being used. Secrets
  using this token are only available if a user is directly connecting to a
  connection, not connecting via a balancing group.

`${CONNECTION_USERNAME}`
: The value of the `username` parameter of the connection being used. Secrets
  using this token are only available if a user is directly connecting to a
  connection, not connecting via a balancing group.

`${USERNAME}`
: The username of the current user, as stored with the user object representing
  that user in the system storing the relevant connection or connection group.
  This is not necessarily the same as `${GUAC_USERNAME}`, which is the username
  provided by the user as part of their credentials when they authenticated.

For example, to automatically define a token called `${LINUX_SERVER_KEY}` that
selects a private key from among several within the same record by searching
for a file named after the current user, the following YAML could be used:

```yaml
LINUX_SERVER_KEY: keeper://Chah0VuPh0ohyeuL4che1o/file/${USERNAME}.pem
```
(guacamole-properties-ksm)=

Retrieving configuration properties from a vault
------------------------------------------------

Secrets for Guacamole configuration properties are provided through [an
additional file within `GUACAMOLE_HOME` called `guacamole.properties.ksm`](guacamole-properties-ksm).
This file is _identical_ to `guacamole.properties` except that the values of properties
are [references to KSM secrets in "Keeper Notation"](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/keeper-notation).
Secrets can be used for any Guacamole configuration property that isn't
required to configure the KSM support.

For example, the following `guacamole.properties.ksm` defines both the
`mysql-username` and `mysql-password` properties using values from a single
record in KSM that contains a username/password pair:

```
mysql-username: keeper://iel4yeic5ahxae7Eereec7/field/login
mysql-password: keeper://iel4yeic5ahxae7Eereec7/field/password
```
