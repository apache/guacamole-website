<h1>Using Guacamole<a class="headerlink" href="#using-guacamole" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Guacamole provides access to much of the functionality of a desktop from within
your web browser. Although most people use remote desktop tools only when
absolutely necessary, we believe that Guacamole must be aimed at becoming a
primary means of accessing desktops, and the interface is thus intended to be
as seamless and unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<section id="home-screen">
<h2>Home screen<a class="headerlink" href="#home-screen" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Once you have successfully logged in, you will be taken to either the Guacamole
home screen, where all available connections are listed, or directly to a
connection, if you only have access to one connection.</p>
<p>The home screen will contain a list of all connections to which you have
access, along with thumbnails of any recently used or active connections. If
you have access to a large number of connections and wish to quickly locate a
specific connection, you can also enter search terms within the “Filter” field
to filter the list of connections by name.</p>
<p><img alt="The Guacamole home screen. The user menu and several recently-usedconnections are visible, along with one active connection." src="_images/guacamole-home-screen.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on any connection will open that connection within the current window
or tab, but multiple connections can be used simultaneously. You can easily
navigate back to the home screen without disconnecting by using your browsers
back button or the “Home” button in the Guacamole menu. Each connection you use
will remain active until explicitly disconnected, or until you navigate away
from Guacamole entirely. Active connections can be seen as thumbnails updating
in real-time on the home screen.</p>
<section id="user-menu">
<h3>User menu<a class="headerlink" href="#user-menu" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>With the exception of the client screen discussed below, all Guacamole screens
contain a menu in the upper-right corner called the “user menu”.  This menu
displays your username and contains several options which depend on your user’s
level of access:</p>
<dl class="simple myst">
<dt>Home</dt><dd><p>Navigates back to the home screen, if you are not already there. If you only
have access to one connection, this will be replaced with a link to that
connection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Settings</dt><dd><p>Navigates to the settings interface, which provides access to user
preferences such as display language. If you have access to administrative
functions, those are found within the settings interface, as well, and are
discussed in more detail in <a class="reference internal" href="administration.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Administration</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Logout</dt><dd><p>Logs out of Guacamole completely, closing all current connections and ending
the Guacamole session.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
</section>
<section id="client-screen">
<h2>Client screen<a class="headerlink" href="#client-screen" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Once you open a connection, you will see a real-time view of the remote
display. You can interact with this display just as you would your normal
desktop. Your mouse and keyboard will function as if they were connected
directly to the remote machine.</p>
<p><img alt="Guacamole client interface, with the Guacamole menuopen." src="_images/guacamole-client-interface.png" /></p>
<p>The remote display will take up the entire browser window, with no buttons or
menus to disturb the view. With the intent of providing a seamless experience,
options specific to remote desktop are hidden within the Guacamole menu, which
can be opened as needed.</p>
<section id="the-guacamole-menu">
<span id="guacamole-menu"></span><h3>The Guacamole menu<a class="headerlink" href="#the-guacamole-menu" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Guacamole menu is a sidebar which is hidden until explicitly shown.  On a
desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can show this menu
by pressing <kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd></kbd>. If you are using a mobile or touchscreen
device that lacks a keyboard, you can also show the menu by swiping right from
the left edge of the screen. To hide the menu, you press <kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd></kbd>
again or swipe left across the screen.</p>
<p>The Guacamole menu provides options for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#using-the-clipboard"><span class="std std-ref">Reading from (and writing to) the clipboard of the remote
desktop</span></a></p></li>

<section id="copying-pasting-text">
<span id="using-the-clipboard"></span><h2>Copying/pasting text<a class="headerlink" href="#copying-pasting-text" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At the top of the Guacamole menu is a text area labeled “clipboard”
along with some basic instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Text copied/cut within Guacamole will appear here. Changes to the text below
will affect the remote clipboard.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The text area functions as an interface between the remote clipboard and the
local clipboard. Text from the local clipboard can be pasted into the text
area, causing that text to be sent to the clipboard of the remote desktop.
Similarly, if you copy or cut text within the remote desktop, you will see that
text within the text area, and can manually copy it into the local clipboard if
desired.</p>
</section>
<section id="switching-and-tiling-connections">
<span id="client-connection-menu"></span><h2>Switching and tiling connections<a class="headerlink" href="#switching-and-tiling-connections" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you have access to more than one connection, clicking the current connection
name at the top of the Guacamole menu will open a drop-down menu containing a
list of your other available connections:</p>
<p><img alt="Connection menu with one connection selected" src="_images/client-connection-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on the name of another connection in this drop-down menu will
immediately switch to that connection. The previous connection will remain
running as a thumbnail within a panel attached to the lower-right corner of the
screen. This panel updates in real-time and remains visible as long as you have
multiple active connections, even if you navigate away to another part of the
Guacamole application:</p>
<p><img alt="Active connection panel" src="_images/client-panel.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on any connection within the panel will navigate back to that
connection, while clicking the “X” icon in the upper-right corner of the
connection thumbnail will immediately close the connection.</p>
<section id="adding-a-connection-to-the-current-view">
<span id="client-tiling"></span><h3>Adding a connection to the current view<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-connection-to-the-current-view" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Multiple connections may also be opened simultaneously within the same view by
clicking the checkboxes next to the names of those connections in the
connection menu:</p>
<p><img alt="Connection menu with two connections selected" src="_images/client-connection-menu-multiple.png" /></p>
<p>All connections opened in this way are automatically arranged in equally-sized
tiles to fill the available area:</p>
<p><img alt="Multiple client displays in a tiled arrangement" src="_images/client-tiled.png" /></p>
<p>With multiple connections displayed as tiles, keyboard interaction and the
Guacamole menu will only affect the currently focused connection, as indicated
by the blue title and border. Clicking or tapping within another connection
will change the focus and allow keyboard interaction with <em>that</em> connection.</p>
</section>
<section id="typing-with-multiple-connections">
<span id="client-broadcast-keyboard"></span><h3>Typing with multiple connections<a class="headerlink" href="#typing-with-multiple-connections" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>By holding down <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> (to select an individual connection) or
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> (to select a rectangle of connections), multiple connection may be
focused at the same time. While multiple connections are focused, each key
pressed will be broadcast across each focused connection:</p>
<p><img alt="Multiple focused client displays in a tiled arrangement" src="_images/client-tiled-multi-focus.png" /></p>
<p>This is particularly useful for running the same series of commands on multiple
computers. Further, since Guacamole automatically translates between the user’s
local keyboard layout and the keyboard layout of the remote server, <em>this will
work as expected even if the keyboard layouts of focused connections do not
match</em>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="disconnecting-and-navigation">
<span id="client-user-menu"></span><h2>Disconnecting and navigation<a class="headerlink" href="#disconnecting-and-navigation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When you are done using the current connection, or you wish to navigate
elsewhere temporarily, options to do so are within the user menu inside the
Guacamole menu:</p>
<p><img alt="The user menu within the Guacamole menu." src="_images/guac-menu-disconnect.png" /></p>
<p>The user menu within the Guacamole menu provides an additional “Disconnect”
option that allows you to explicitly close the current connection only.
Clicking “Logout” will also implicitly disconnect all active connections,
including the current connection.</p>
<p>Navigating back to the home screen or to the settings screen will not
disconnect you: your connection will continue running in the background while
you change settings or initiate another connection, and you can resume any
active connection by clicking on it within the home screen.</p>
</section>
<section id="sharing-the-connection">
<span id="client-share-menu"></span><h2>Sharing the connection<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-the-connection" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If the Guacamole server is configured to allow connection sharing, and you have
been granted permission to share the current connection, an additional “Share”
menu will appear next to your username in the Guacamole menu. Clicking on this
menu opens a list of options for sharing the current connection.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/guac-menu-share.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking any of the options within the “Share” menu will immediately generate a
unique share link which can be distributed to anyone, even to users which do
not otherwise have accounts within the same Guacamole system.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/guac-menu-share-link.png" /></p>
<p>When the link is visited, that user will be given temporary access to your
connection, restricted according to the sharing option chosen. This access, and
the validity of the link overall, lasts only until you disconnect. Once the
connection is closed, the link ceases to be valid, and any users sharing the
connection with you will be disconnected.</p>
</section>
<section id="transferring-files">
<span id="file-transfer"></span><h2>Transferring files<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-files" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can transfer files back and forth between your local computer and the
remote desktop if it is supported by the underlying protocol and enabled on the
connection. Currently, Guacamole supports file transfer for VNC, RDP, and SSH,
using either the native file transfer support of the protocol or SFTP.</p>
<p>Files can be transferred to the remote computer by dragging and dropping the
files into your browser window, or through using the file browser located in
the Guacamole menu.</p>
<section id="using-the-file-browser">
<span id="file-browser"></span><h3>Using the file browser<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-file-browser" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If file transfer is enabled on the connection, you will see one or more
filesystem devices listed within the Guacamole menu. Clicking on one of the
filesystems opens a file browser which lists the files and directories within
that filesystem.</p>
<p><img alt="The file browser within the Guacamole menu." src="_images/file-browser.png" /></p>
<p>Double-clicking on any directory will change the current location of the file
browser to that directory, updating the list of files shown as well as the
“breadcrumbs” at the top of the file browser. Clicking on any of the directory
names listed in the breadcrumbs will bring you back to that directory, and
clicking on the drive icon on the far left will bring you all the way back to
the root level.</p>
<p>Downloads are initiated by double-clicking on any file shown, while uploads are
initiated by clicking the “Upload Files” button. Clicking “Upload Files” will
open a file browsing dialog where you can choose one or more files from your
local computer, ultimately uploading the selected files to the directory
currently displayed within the file browser.</p>
<p>The state of all file uploads can be observed within the notification dialog
that appears once an upload begins, and can be cleared once completed by
clicking the “Clear” button. Downloads are tracked through your browser’s own
download notification system.</p>
<p><img alt="In-progress and completed file transfers." src="_images/file-transfers.png" /></p>
<p>When you are done browsing the filesystem and transferring files, click “Back”
to return to the Guacamole menu.</p>

<section id="the-rdp-virtual-drive">
<span id="rdp-virtual-drive"></span><h3>The RDP virtual drive<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rdp-virtual-drive" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>RDP provides its own native support for file transfer called “drive
redirection” or “RDPDR”. Guacamole provides support for this mechanism by
emulating a virtual drive. Typically, this virtual drive will appear as a
network drive within the RDP session. Files uploaded and downloaded will be
preserved within this drive, even after disconnecting.</p>
<p><img alt="The Guacamole drive within a Windows RDP session." src="_images/guacamole-drive.png" /></p>
<p>Files can be downloaded from this drive using the file browser in the Guacamole
menu or using the special “Download” folder within the virtual drive. All files
dropped into this folder will automatically begin uploading to the client, and
thus downloading through the browser.</p>

<p>In addition to traditional drag-and-drop and the file browser, Guacamole’s SSH
support can be used with the <strong class="program">guacctl</strong> utility. The <strong class="program">guacctl</strong>
utility is a simple shell script <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/guacamole-server/master/bin/guacctl">included with Guacamole</a> which

<section id="on-screen-keyboard">
<span id="using-the-osk"></span><h2>On-screen keyboard<a class="headerlink" href="#on-screen-keyboard" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Certain key combinations are impossible to press within a web application like
Guacamole because they are reserved by the operating system
(<kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Del</kbd></kbd> or <kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Tab</kbd></kbd>, for example) or by the web browser. If
you press one of these reserved combinations, the effect will be observed
locally, not remotely, and the remote desktop will receive only some of the
keys.</p>
<p>Guacamole provides its own, built-in on-screen keyboard which allows keys to be
sent to the remote desktop without affecting the local system. If the device
you’re using does not have certain keys which the remote desktop depends on,
such as the arrow keys or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd>, you can use the on-screen keyboard for
this, too. You can show the on-screen keyboard by selecting the “On-screen
keyboard” option from the menu.</p>
<p>Clicking (or tapping) the buttons of the on-screen keyboard has the same effect
as pressing the same buttons on a real keyboard, except that the operating
system and browser will not intercept these keypresses; they will only be sent
to the remote desktop.</p>

<section id="scaling-the-display">
<span id="scaling-display"></span><h2>Scaling the display<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-the-display" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Guacamole will default to shrinking or expanding the remote display to fit the
browser window exactly, but this is not necessarily ideal. If the remote
display is much larger than your local display, the screen may be impossible to
see or interact with. This is especially true for mobile phones, whose screens
need to be small enough to fit in the average hand.</p>
<p>You can scale the display on touch devices by using the familiar pinch gesture.
Place two fingers on the screen and bring them closer together to zoom out or
further apart to zoom in.</p>
<p>If your device lacks a touch screen, you can also control the zoom level
through the menu. The controls for zooming in and out are located at the bottom
of the menu. The current zoom level is displayed between two “-” and “+”
buttons which control the zoom level in 10% increments.</p>

<section id="mobile-or-touch-devices">
<span id="touch-devices"></span><h2>Mobile or touch devices<a class="headerlink" href="#mobile-or-touch-devices" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Guacamole is designed to work equally well across all HTML5 browsers, including
those of mobile devices. It will automatically handle input from a touch screen
or a traditional mouse (or both, if you happen to have such a gifted computer),
and provides alternative input methods for devices which lack a physical
keyboard.</p>
<section id="mouse-emulation">
<span id="touch-mouse"></span><h3>Mouse emulation<a class="headerlink" href="#mouse-emulation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In the case that your device has a touchscreen and lacks a mouse, Guacamole
will emulate a mouse for the sake of interacting with remote desktops that
expect mouse input. By default, Guacamole uses “absolute” mouse emulation. This
means that the mouse pointer is positioned at the location of each tap on the
screen.</p>
<p>In both absolute and relative modes, you can click-and-drag by tapping the
screen and then quickly placing your finger back down. This gesture only causes
the mouse button to press down, but does not release it again until you lift
your finger back up.</p>
<section id="absolute-mode-touchscreen">
<span id="absolute-mouse-emulation"></span><h4>Absolute mode (touchscreen)<a class="headerlink" href="#absolute-mode-touchscreen" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Absolute mouse emulation is the default as it tends to be what people expect
when using a touch device to interact with applications designed for mouse
input.</p>
<p>Each tap on the screen is translated into a left-click at that position.
Right-clicking is accomplished through pressing and holding your finger on the
screen. If parts of the remote display are off-screen, you can drag your finger
around the screen to pan the off-screen parts back into view.</p>
<p>Although absolute mouse emulation works generally well, a finger makes for a
very inaccurate pointing device. To address this, Guacamole also provides
“relative” mouse emulation. Relative mouse emulation provides a way to deal
with the need for accurate pointer control, when a true pointer device is not
present.</p>

<section id="relative-mode-touchpad">
<span id="relative-mouse-emulation"></span><h4>Relative mode (touchpad)<a class="headerlink" href="#relative-mode-touchpad" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Guacamole’s relative mouse emulation behaves similarly to the touchpad present
on most modern laptops. You drag your finger across the display to move the
mouse pointer, and tap the display to left-click. The pointer moves relative to
the motion of your finger. Right-clicking is accomplished with a two-finger
tap, and middle-clicking with a three-finger tap. The mouse scroll wheel can be
operated by dragging two fingers up or down.</p>
<p>Because the relative mouse emulation reserves so many gestures for the
different mouse buttons and actions, common touch gestures like panning and
pinch-to-zoom will not work while relative mouse emulation is enabled. Instead,
the screen will automatically pan to keep the mouse pointer in view, and you
can zoom through the buttons in the menu.</p>

<section id="typing-without-a-physical-keyboard">
<span id="text-input"></span><h3>Typing without a physical keyboard<a class="headerlink" href="#typing-without-a-physical-keyboard" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Many mobile devices lack a physical keyboard entirely, and instead provide
their own on-screen keyboards. As these are not true keyboards per se and do
not produce key presses, Guacamole’s text input mode is required for typing on
these platforms.</p>
<p>“Text input” allows input of keystrokes based on the input of text.  Choosing
“Text input” tells Guacamole to infer keystrokes by tracking text entered,
rather than relying on actual key presses. Guacamole will instead determine the
combination of keypresses necessary to produce the same pattern of input,
including deletions.</p>
<p>If you wish to type via an IME (input method editor), such as those required
for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, text input mode is required for this as well.
Such IMEs function through the explicit insertion of text and do not send
traditional key presses. Using text input mode within Guacamole thus allows you
to use a locally-installed IME, without requiring the IME to be installed on
the remote desktop.</p>

<section id="changing-preferences">
<span id="preferences"></span><h2>Changing preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-preferences" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>User preferences can be changed within the settings screen. These preferences
are stored locally within the browser, so if you use multiple computers to
access Guacamole, you can have different settings for each location. The
settings screen allows users to change the language of the Guacamole interface,
to change the default input method used by Guacamole connections, and to change
the default mouse emulation mode for if a touch device is used. If you have
sufficient permissions, you may also change your password, or administer the
system.</p>
<p><img alt="Guacamole preferences screen." src="_images/guacamole-preferences.png" /></p>
<section id="display-language">
<h3>Display language<a class="headerlink" href="#display-language" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The Guacamole interface is currently available in English, Dutch, French,
German, Italian, and Russian. By default, Guacamole will attempt to determine
the appropriate display language by checking the language preferences of the
browser in use. If this fails, or the browser is using a language not yet
available within Guacamole, English will be used as a fallback.</p>
<p>If you wish to override the current display language, you can do so by
selecting a different language within the “Display language” field. The change
will take effect immediately.</p>
</section>
<section id="changing-your-password">
<span id="changing-password"></span><h3>Changing your password<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-your-password" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>System administrators can restrict the ability of individual users to change
their own passwords, so this section may not always be available.  If your
account <em>does</em> have permission, the preferences screen will contain a “Change
Password” section.</p>
<p>To change your password, you must provide your current password, enter the
desired new password, and click “Update Password”. You will remain logged in,
and the change will affect any future login attempt.</p>
</section>
<section id="default-input-settings">
<h3>Default input settings<a class="headerlink" href="#default-input-settings" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Guacamole provides multiple keyboard input methods and multiple mouse emulation
modes. Many of these settings are specifically useful for touch devices, while
others are aimed mainly at traditional desktop use.  By default, Guacamole will
use the keyboard and mouse modes most commonly preferred by users, but you can
change these defaults if they do not fit your tastes or your current device.</p>
<p>The choices available mirror those within the Guacamole menu discussed earlier
in this chapter, and changing these settings will affect the default values
selected within the Guacamole menu of future connections.</p>
