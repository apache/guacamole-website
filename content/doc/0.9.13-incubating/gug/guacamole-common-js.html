        other components that conform to the design of Guacamole, such as
        projects using libguac or guacamole-common. This API is called
        guacamole-common-js.</p><p>guacamole-common-js provides a JavaScript implementation of a
        Guacamole client, as well as tunneling mechanisms for getting protocol
        data out of JavaScript and into guacd or the server side of a web
        application.</p><p>For convenience, it also provides mouse and keyboard abstraction objects that translate
        JavaScript mouse, touch, and keyboard events into consistent data that Guacamole can more
        easily digest. The extendable on-screen keyboard that was developed for the Guacamole web
        application is also included.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="guacamole-client"></a>Guacamole client</h2></div></div></div><p>The main benefit to using the JavaScript API is the full Guacamole
            client implementation, which implements all Guacamole instructions,
            and makes use of the tunnel implementations provided by both the
            JavaScript and Java APIs.</p><p>Using the Guacamole client is straightforward. The client, like
            all other objects within the JavaScript API, is within the
                <code class="code">Guacamole</code> namespace. It is instantiated given an
            existing, unconnected tunnel:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var client = new Guacamole.Client(tunnel);</pre></div><p>Once you have the client, it won't immediately appear within the
            DOM. You need to add its display element manually:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">document.body.appendChild(client.getDisplay().getElement());</pre></div><p>At this point, the client will be visible, rendering all updates
            as soon as they are received through the tunnel.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">client.connect();</pre></div><p>It is possible to pass arbitrary data to the tunnel during
            connection which can be used for authentication or for choosing a
            particular connection. When the <code class="methodname">connect()</code>
            function of the Guacamole client is called, it in turn calls the
                <code class="methodname">connect()</code> function of the tunnel
            originally given to the client, establishing a connection.</p><div class="important"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>When creating the <code class="classname">Guacamole.Client</code>, the
                tunnel used must not already be connected. The
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Client</code> will call the
                    <code class="methodname">connect()</code> function for you when its
                own <code class="methodname">connect()</code> function is invoked. If
                the tunnel is already connected when it is given to the
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Client</code>, connection may not
                work at all.</p></div><p>In general, all instructions available within the Guacamole
            protocol are automatically handled by the Guacamole client,
            including instructions related to audio and video. The only
            instructions which you must handle yourself are "name" (used to name
            the connection), "clipboard" (used to update clipboard data on the
            client side), and "error" (used when something goes wrong
            server-side). Each of these instructions has a corresponding event
            handler; you need only supply functions to handle these events. If
            any of these event handlers are left unset, the corresponding
            instructions are simply ignored.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="http-tunnel"></a>HTTP tunnel</h2></div></div></div><p>Both the Java and JavaScript API implement corresponding ends of
            an HTTP tunnel, based on
            <code class="classname">XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p><p>The tunnel is a true stream - there is no polling. An initial
            request is made from the JavaScript side, and this request is
            handled on the Java side. While this request is open, data is
            streamed along the connection, and instructions within this stream
            are handled as soon as they are received by the client.</p><p>While data is being streamed along this existing connection, a
            second connection attempt is made. Data continues to be streamed
            along the original connection until the server receives and handles
            the second request, at which point the original connection closes
            and the stream is transferred to the new connection.</p><p>This process repeats, alternating between active streams, thus
            creating an unbroken sequence of instructions, while also allowing
            JavaScript to free any memory used by the previously active
            connection.</p><p>The tunnel is created by supplying the relative URL to the
            server-side tunnel servlet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var tunnel = new Guacamole.Tunnel("tunnel");</pre></div><p>Once created, the tunnel can be passed to a
                <code class="classname">Guacamole.Client</code> for use in a Guacamole
            connection.</p><p>The tunnel actually takes care of the Guacamole protocol parsing
            on behalf of the client, triggering "oninstruction" events for every
            instruction received, splitting each element into elements of an
            array so that the client doesn't have to.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="input-abstraction"></a>Input abstraction</h2></div></div></div><p>Browsers can be rather finicky when it comes to keyboard and mouse
            input, not to mention touch events. There is little agreement on
            which keyboard events get fired when, and what detail about the
            event is made available to JavaScript. Touch and mouse events can
            also cause confusion, as most browsers will generate
                <span class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> events when the user touches the
            screen (for compatibility with JavaScript code that only handles
            mouse events), making it more difficult for applications to support
            both mouse and touch independently.</p><p>The Guacamole JavaScript API abstracts mouse, keyboard, and touch
            interaction, providing several helper objects which act as an
            abstract interface between you and the browser events.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="guacamole-mouse"></a>Mouse</h3></div></div></div><p>Mouse event abstraction is provided by the
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Mouse</code> object. Given an
                arbitrary DOM element, <code class="classname">Guacamole.Mouse</code>
                triggers <span class="property">onmousedown</span>,
                    <span class="property">onmousemove</span>, and
                    <span class="property">onmouseup</span> events which are consistent
                across browsers. This object only response. to true mouse
                events. Mouse events which are actually the result of touch
                events are ignored.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var element = document.getElementById("some-arbitrary-id");
var mouse = new Guacamole.Mouse(element);

mouse.onmousedown =
mouse.onmousemove =
mouse.onmouseup   = function(state) {

    // Do something with the mouse state received ...

};</pre></div><p>The handles of each event are given an instance of
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Mouse.State</code> which
                represents the current state of the mouse, containing the state
                of each button (including the scroll wheel) as well as the X and
                Y coordinates of the pointer in pixels.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="guacamole-touch"></a>Touch</h3></div></div></div><p>Touch event abstraction is provided by either
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Touchpad</code> (emulates a
                touchpad to generate artificial mouse events) or
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Touchscreen</code> (emulates a
                touchscreen, again generating artificial mouse events).
                Guacamole uses the touchpad emulation, as this provides the most
                flexibility and mouse-like features, including scrollwheel and
                clicking with different buttons, but your preferences may
                differ.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var element = document.getElementById("some-arbitrary-id");
var touch = new Guacamole.Touchpad(element); // or Guacamole.Touchscreen

touch.onmousedown =
touch.onmousemove =
touch.onmouseup   = function(state) {

    // Do something with the mouse state received ...

};</pre></div><p>Note that even though these objects are touch-specific, they
                still provide mouse events. The state object given to the event
                handlers of each event is still an instance of
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Mouse.State</code>.</p><p>Ultimately, you could assign the same event handler to all the
                events of both an instance of
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Mouse</code> as well as
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Touchscreen</code> or
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Touchpad</code>, and you would
                magically gain mouse and touch support. This support, being
                driven by the needs of remote desktop, is naturally geared
                around the mouse and providing a reasonable means of interacting
                with it. For an actual mouse, events are translated simply and
                literally, while touch events go through additional emulation
                and heuristics. From the perspective of the user and the code,
                this is all transparent.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="guacamole-keyboard"></a>Keyboard</h3></div></div></div><p>Keyboard events in Guacamole are abstracted with the
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Keyboard</code> object as only
                keyup and keydown events; there is no keypress like there is in
                JavaScript. Further, all the craziness of keycodes vs. scancodes
                vs. key identifiers normally present across browsers is
                abstracted away. All your event handlers will see is an X11
                keysym, which represent every key unambiguously. Conveniently,
                X11 keysyms are also what the Guacamole protocol requires, so if
                you want to use <code class="classname">Guacamole.Keyboard</code> to
                drive key events sent over the Guacamole protocol, everything
                can be connected directly.</p><p>Just like the other input abstraction objects,
                    <code class="classname">Guacamole.Keyboard</code> requires a DOM
                element as an event target. Only key events directed at this
                element will be handled.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var keyboard = new Guacamole.Keyboard(document);

keyboard.onkeydown = function(keysym) {
    // Do something ...
};

keyboard.onkeyup = function(keysym) {
    // Do something ...
};</pre></div><p>In this case, we are using <code class="classname">document</code> as
                the event target, thus receiving all key events while the
                browser window (or tab) has focus.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="on-screen-keyboard"></a>On-screen keyboard</h2></div></div></div><p>The Guacamole JavaScript API also provides an extendable on-screen
            keyboard, <code class="classname">Guacamole.OnScreenKeyboard</code>, which
            requires the URL of an XML file describing the keyboard layout. The
            on-screen keyboard object provides no hard-coded layout information;
            the keyboard layout is described entirely within the XML layout
            file.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="keyboard-layouts"></a>Keyboard layouts</h3></div></div></div><p>The keyboard layout XML included in the Guacamole web
                application would be a good place to start regarding how these
                layout files are written, but in general, the keyboard is simply
                a set of rows or columns, denoted with <code class="code">&lt;row&gt;</code> and
                    <code class="code">&lt;column&gt;</code> tags respectively, where each can
                be nested within the other as desired.</p><p>Each key is represented with a <code class="code">&lt;key&gt;</code> tag, but
                this is not what the user sees, nor what generates the key
                event. Each key contains any number of <code class="code">&lt;cap&gt;</code>
                tags, which represent the visible part of the key. The cap
                describes which X11 keysym will be sent when the key is pressed.
                Each cap can be associated with any combination of arbitrary
                modifier flags which dictate when that cap is active.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;keyboard lang="en_US" layout="example" size="5"&gt;
    &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;key size="4"&gt;
            &lt;cap modifier="shift" keysym="0xFFE1"&gt;Shift&lt;/cap&gt;
        &lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;
            &lt;cap&gt;a&lt;/cap&gt;
            &lt;cap if="shift"&gt;A&lt;/cap&gt;
        &lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/keyboard&gt;</pre></div><p>Here we have a very simple keyboard which defines only two
                keys: "shift" (a modifier) and the letter "a". When "shift" is
                pressed, it sets the "shift" modifier, affecting other keys in
                the keyboard. The "a" key has two caps: one lowercase (the
                default) and one uppercase (which requires the shift modifier to
                be active).</p><p>Notice that the shift key needed the keysym explicitly
                specified, while the "a" key did not. This is because the
                on-screen keyboard will automatically derive the correct keysym
                from the text of the key cap if the text contains only a single
                character.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="displaying-osk"></a>Displaying the keyboard</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you have a keyboard layout available, adding an on-screen
                keyboard to your application is simple:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Add keyboard to body
var keyboard = new Guacamole.OnScreenKeyboard("path/to/layout.xml");
document.body.appendChild(keyboard.getElement());

// Set size of keyboard to 100 pixels
keyboard.resize(100);</pre></div><p>Here, we have explicitly specified the width of the keyboard
                as 100 pixels. Normally, you would determine this by inspecting
                the width of the containing component, or by deciding on a
                reasonable width beforehand. Once the width is given, the height
                of the keyboard is determined based on the arrangement of each
                row.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="styling-the-keyboard"></a>Styling the keyboard</h3></div></div></div><p>While the <code class="classname">Guacamole.OnScreenKeyboard</code>
                object will handle most of the layout, you will still need to
                style everything yourself with CSS to get the elements to render
                properly and the keys to change state when clicked or activated.
                It defines several CSS classes, which you will need to manually
                style to get things looking as desired:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="classname">guac-keyboard</code></span></dt><dd><p>This class is assigned to the root element
                            containing the entire keyboard, returned by

                            intended to behave as keys with no visible styling
                            or caps.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="classname">guac-keyboard-key-container</code></span></dt><dd><p>Assigned to the <code class="code">div</code> element which

                            scaled relative to the size specified in the layout
                            XML and the size given to the <code class="code">resize()</code>

                            rules, you can take advantage of this and cause
                            inactive caps to appear on the key in a corner (for

                    application would be a good place to start to see how the
