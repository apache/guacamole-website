            properly, or something is wrong with the network. Thankfully,
            Guacamole and all its components log errors thoroughly, so the
            problem can usually be traced down fairly easily if you know where
            to look. Troubleshooting Guacamole usually boils down to checking
            either syslog or your servlet container's logs (likely
            Tomcat).</p><p>Failing all that, you can always post a question in the forums, or
            if you truly feel you've discovered a bug, you can create a new
            ticket in Trac. Beware that if something isn't working, and there
            are errors in the logs describing the problem, it is usually not a
            bug, and the best place to handle such things is through consulting
            this guide or the forums.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm139895976561008"></a>No graphics appear</h3></div></div></div><a id="idm139895976560272" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm139895976559408" class="indexterm"></a><p>If you <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> see any graphics appear, or you see "Connecting,
                waiting for first update..." for a while and then are disconnected, the most likely
                cause is a proxy.</p><p>Guacamole relies on streaming data to you over a persistent connection. If
                software between Guacamole and your browser is buffering all incoming data, such as
                a proxy, this data never makes it to your browser, and you will just see it wait
                indefinitely. Eventually, thinking the client has disconnected, Guacamole closes the
                connection, at which point the proxy finally flushes its buffer and you see
                graphics! ... just in time to see it disconnect.</p><p>The solution here is to either modify your proxy settings to flush packets
                immediately as they are received, or to use HTTPS. Proxies are required to pass
                HTTPS through untouched, and this usually solves the problem.</p><p>Even if you aren't aware of any proxy, there may be one in place. Corporate
                firewalls very often incorporate proxies. Antivirus software may buffer incoming
                data until the connection is closed and the data is scanned for viruses.
                Virtualization software may detect HTTP data and buffer the connection just like a
                proxy. If all else fails, try HTTPS - it's the only secure way to do this
                anyway.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm139895976554736"></a>Connections involving Unicode don't work</h3></div></div></div><a id="idm139895976553968" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm139895976553072" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm139895976552176" class="indexterm"></a><p>If you are using Tomcat, beware that you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> set the

                you need to find out whether it requires special options to support UTF-8 in URIs,
                and change the required settings to enable such support.</p><p>Without UTF-8 support enabled for URIs, Unicode characters in connection names
                will not be received properly when connecting, and Guacamole will thing the
                connection you requested does not exist. Similarly, if you are using the built-in
                administration interface, parameters involving Unicode characters will not save

            informational messages and errors to syslog. Specifically, guacd
            uses syslog, and it exposes this logging facility to everything it
            loads (client plugins), thus if the VNC or RDP support plugins
            encounter errors, they log those errors over the logging facilities
            exposed by guacd, in this case syslog.</p><p>Once you guacd is started, you'll see entries like the following
            in syslog:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">guacd[19663]: Guacamole proxy daemon (guacd) version 0.7.0

guacd[19666]: Listening on host 127.0.0.1, port 4823</pre></div><p>Each entry relevant to Guacamole has the prefix "guacd", denoting
            the program that produced the entry, followed by the process ID,
            followed by the message. The entries above show guacamole starting
            successfully and listening on a non-default port 4823.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="guacd-errors"></a>guacd errors</h3></div></div></div><a id="idm139895976601984" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idm139895976600640" class="indexterm"></a><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976599296"></a>Unable to bind socket to any addresses.</h4></div></div></div><p>This means that guacd failed to start up at all because
                    the port it wants to listen on is already taken at all
                    addresses attempted. The details of what guacd tried will be
                    listed in the log entries above this. To solve the problem,
                    find what port guacd was trying to listen on (the default is
                    4822) and check if any other service is listening on that
                    port.</p><p>If another service is listening on the default port, you
                    can always specify a non-standard port for guacd by using
                    the <code class="option">-l<em class="replaceable"><code> PORT</code></em></code>
                    option (that's a lowercase "L", not a number "1"), where
                        <em class="replaceable"><code>PORT</code></em> is the number of the
                    port to listen on. Beware that you will likely have to
                    modify <code class="filename">guacamole.properties</code> so that
                    Guacamole knows how to connect to guacd.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976595088"></a>Unable to start <em class="replaceable"><code>input</code></em>

                    receives input from the connected client, and the other that
                    produces output for the client. If either of these fails to
                    start, the above error will be logged along with the
                    cause.</p><p>If it is the output thread that fails to start, the
                    message will instead read: "Unable to start output

                    cause the connection to immediately terminate, with the
                    cause of the error specific to the plugin in use. The cause
                    should be detailed in the log messages above the error. If
                    those log messages don't make sense, you may have found a

                    into the background (unless instructed otherwise). The word
                    "fork()" above is a reference to the C function call that
                    does this. There are several calls to this function, each of
                    which might fail if system resources are lacking or
                    something went wrong at a low level. If you see this
                    message, it is probably not a bug in Guacamole, but rather a
                    problem with the load level of your system.</p><p>This message may also appear as "Could not fork() group

                    its working directory to the root directory. This is to
                    prevent locking the current directory in case it needs to be
                    unmounted, etc. If guacd cannot do this, this error will be
                    logged, along with the cause.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976586336"></a>Unable to redirect standard file descriptors to
                    /dev/null</h4></div></div></div><p>As guacd starts, it also has to redirect STDOUT, STDERR,
                    and STDIN to <code class="filename">/dev/null</code> such that
                    attempts to use these output mechanisms do not pollute the
                    active console. Though guacd and client plugins will use the
                    exposed logging facilities (and thus syslog) rather than
                    STDOUT or STDERR, libraries used by client plugins are often
                    written only from the mindset of a typical client, and use
                    standard output mechanisms for debug logging. Not
                    redirecting these would result in undesired output to the
                    console.</p><p>If guacd cannot redirect these file descriptors for any
                    reason, this error will be logged, along with the
                    cause.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976583328"></a>Error parsing given address or port:
                        <em class="replaceable"><code>HOSTNAME</code></em></h4></div></div></div><p>If you specified a host or port to listen on via
                    commandline options, and that host or port is actually
                    invalid, you will see this error. Fix the corresponding

                    listen on that socket. If it can't even open the socket,
                    this error will be logged, and guacd will exit. The cause is
                    most likely related to permissions, and is logged along with
                    the error.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976579776"></a>Unable to resolve host</h4></div></div></div><p>If the hostname you specified on the commandline cannot be

                    guacd, and does not relate to whatever remote desktop
                    servers you may be trying to use; it relates only to the
                    host guacd is trying to listen on. Check the hostname or IP
                    address specified on the commandline. If that checks out,
                    there may be a problem with your DNS or your network.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976577920"></a>Could not become a daemon</h4></div></div></div><p>In order to become a "daemon" (that is, in order to run in
                    the background as a system process), guacd must create and
                    exit from several processes, redirect file descriptors, etc.
                    If any of these steps fails, guacd will not become a daemon,
                    and it will log this message and exit. The reason guacd
                    could not become a daemon will be in the previous error

                    useful for init scripts. If you see this error, it likely
                    means the user guacd is running as does not have permission
                    to write this file. The true cause of the error will be
                    logged in the same entry. Check which user guacd is running

                    for any reason, guacd is unable to listen on the socket,
                    guacd will exit and log this message along with the cause,

                    As this connection can never be closed unless all references
                    to the descriptor are closed, the server must close its copy
                    such that the client is the only remaining holder of the

                    which the client is obligated to respond to as soon as it is
                    received. If guacd cannot send this instruction, this error
                    will be logged, along with the cause. Chances are the

                    will be logged. Usually this means simply that the
                    connection was closed, but it could also indicate that the
                    version of the client in use is so old that it doesn't
                    support the current Guacamole protocol at all. If the cause

                    are created through the login process.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="guacamole-tunnel-errors"></a>Tunnel errors</h3></div></div></div><p>The tunnel frequently returns errors if guacd is killed, the
                connection is closed, or the client abruptly closes the
                connection.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976407056"></a>No such tunnel</h4></div></div></div><p>An attempt was made to use a tunnel which does not
                    actually exist. This is usually just the JavaScript client
                    sending a leftover message or two while it hasn't realized
                    that the server has disconnected. If this error happens
                    consistently and is associated with Guacamole generally not
                    working, it could be a bug.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976405312"></a>No tunnel created</h4></div></div></div><p>A connection attempt for a specific configuration was
                    made, but the connection failed, and no tunnel was created.
                    This is usually because the user was not authorized to use
                    that connection, and thus no tunnel was created for access
                    to that connection.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976403648"></a>No query string provided</h4></div></div></div><p>When the JavaScript client is communicating with the HTTP
                    tunnel, it <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> provide data in the
                    query string describing whether it wants to connect, read,
                    or write. If this data is missing as the error indicates,
                    there is a bug in the HTTP tunnel.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976401536"></a>Tunnel reached end of stream</h4></div></div></div><p>An attempt to read from the tunnel was made, but the
                    tunnel in question has already reached the end of stream
                    (the connection is closed). This is mostly an informative
                    error, and can be ignored.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976399936"></a>Tunnel is closed</h4></div></div></div><p>An attempt to read from the tunnel was made, but the
                    tunnel in question is already closed. This can happen if the
                    client or guacd have closed the connection, but the client
                    has not yet settled down and is still making read attempts.
                    As there can be lags between when connections close and when
                    the client realizes it, this can be safely ignored.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976398160"></a>End of stream during initial handshake</h4></div></div></div><p>If guacd closes the connection suddenly without allowing
                    the client to complete the initial handshake required by the
                    Guacamole protocol, this error will appear in the logs. If
                    you see this error, you should check syslog for any errors
                    logged by guacd to determine why it closed the connection so
                    early.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm139895976396416"></a>Element terminator of instruction was not ';' nor

                    requires individual parts of instructions (called

                    they do not, then something has gone wrong during
                    transmission. This usually indicates a bug in the client

                    requires each element of an instruction to have a length
                    prefix, which must be composed entirely of numeric
                    characters (digits 0 through 9). If a non-numeric character
                    is read, then something has gone wrong during transmission.
                    This usually indicates a bug in the client plugin in use,
