        <p>When you visit a Guacamole instance for the first time, you will see the login screen.
            This screen authenticates you with Guacamole, allowing you to use Guacamole to interact
            with one or more remote desktops. </p>
        <p>Enter your username and password and click "login". You will then be given a list of
            available remote desktop connections to choose from. If you have used Guacamole in that
            specific web browser before, you will also see thumbnails of the screens of recently
            used connections. </p>
        <p>Keep in mind this is the login for Guacamole, and not necessarily the login for the
            remote desktop you wish to connect to. The username and password you give Guacamole
            grants you access to the Guacamole system only. The usernames and passwords required for
            the remote desktops you have access to through Guacamole are independent. </p>

        <p>Once logged in, you will be presented with a list of connections. Selecting a
            connection from this list will open that connection in a new window or tab. The
            connection list interface will remain open and running in the previous window or tab, as
            it is the only access point for other connections, the clipboard, and settings.</p>
        <p>Multiple connections can be used simultaneously. </p>

        <p>If you don't wish to connect to any desktops, you can also logout from this screen by
            clicking the "logout" button. Beware that this will disconnect you from any of your open

        <p>Once you open a connection, you will see an image of a desktop. You can interact with
            this image just as you would your normal desktop, or any remote desktop client. </p>
        <p>Clicking on parts of the image will affect the remote desktop as if you were clicking
            on the desktop directly. Typing causes keys to be typed remotely as if you were using a
            keyboard connected directly to the remote machine. </p>

            <p>The clipboard can be manipulated using the clipboard editor accessible near the
                bottom of the connection list interface.</p>
            <p>Web browsers don't provide access to clipboard data, thus true synchronization
                between your local clipboard and the remote clipboard is impossible. Instead, the
                clipboard editor acts as an intermediary. You can paste text from your clipboard
                into the editor, and it will be sent to the remote clipboard. If you cut or copy
                text remotely, that text will be visible in the clipboard editor locally, where you
                can then select and copy it.</p>
            <p>All open Guacamole connections use this common clipboard, thus copying and pasting
                between connections is seamless; you do not need to visit the clipboard editor to
                copy and paste from one connection to another.</p>

            <p>Certain key combinations are impossible to press within a web application like
                Guacamole because they are reserved by the operating system (Ctrl-Alt-Del or
                Alt-Tab, for example) or by the web browser. If you press one of these reserved
                combinations, the effect will be observed locally, not remotely, and the remote
                desktop will receive only some of the keys. </p>
            <p>Guacamole provides an on-screen keyboard such that key events can be sent to the
                remote machine without affecting the local browser. You can show the on-screen
                keyboard by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Shift. Pressing the Ctrl-Alt-Shift again will hide the
                on-screen keyboard.</p>
            <p>Clicking on the buttons of the on-screen keyboard has the same effect as pressing
                the same buttons on a real keyboard, except that the operating system and browser
                will not intercept these keypresses; they will only be sent remotely. </p>

            <p>When you are done and wish to logout of Guacamole completely, find the original
                connection interface tab and click the "logout" button. Beware that this will close
                all current connections and end your Guacamole session. </p>
            <p>Note that this is not the same as disconnecting from a single connection. To
                disconnect, simply close the tab or window with the remote desktop in it. Closing a
                tab or window automatically disconnects from the associated remote desktop without
                logging you out of Guacamole completely. </p>
            <p>If you logout of Guacamole, all active connections are closed, and can only be
                accessed by logging in again and reconnecting.</p>

        <a id="idp1104224" class="indexterm"></a>
        <p>Guacamole can be used on devices that have touchscreens, even when
            those touchscreens are the sole means of input, such as most tablets
            and mobile phones.</p>
        <div class="section" title="Moving the mouse"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="using-mouse"></a>Moving the mouse</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <a id="idp1107088" class="indexterm"></a>
            <p>As a finger makes for a very inaccurate pointing device,
                especially for mouse-driven applications designed for precise
                input, the default mode for touch-based mouse input in Guacamole
                is touchpad emulation.</p>
            <p>Guacamole's touchpad emulation is similar in behavior to the
                touchpad present on most modern laptops. Drag your finger across
                the display to move the mouse pointer, and tap the display to
                left-click. Right-clicking is accomplished with a two-finger
                tap, and middle-clicking with a three-finger tap.</p>
            <p>Click-and-drag by tapping the screen and then quickly placing
                your finger back down. This gesture only causes the mouse button
                to press down, but does not release it again until you lift your
                finger back up.</p>
            <p>The mouse scroll wheel can be operated by dragging two fingers
                up or down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" title="Zooming in"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="zooming"></a>Zooming in</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <a id="idp1111712" class="indexterm"></a>
            <p>Many touch-enabled devices have small screens, which makes the
                larger screens of a typical remote desktop hard to see and
                interact with. If you want to temporarily zoom in, long-press on
                the display. This will reveal a rectangular magnifier that can
                be dragged around the screen, revealing detail below it at full
                resolution.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure">

                    </div></div>
            </div>
            <p>Tapping outside this magnifier closes the magnifier, while
                tapping inside engages a typing mode.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" title="Typing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="typing"></a>Typing</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <a id="idp1118512" class="indexterm"></a>
            <p>In most cases, if your device has a hardware keyboard or you
                use a bluetooth keyboard, you will not need to do anything
                special in order to type; you can just press keys and expect the
                same effect you would have on a desktop.</p>
            <p>For devices that lack a hardware keyboard, you need to bring
                Guacamole into "typing mode" by long-pressing on the display to
                bring up the magnifier. Tap on the magnifier to bring up your
                device's on-screen keyboard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" title="Panning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="panning"></a>Panning</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <a id="idp1122000" class="indexterm"></a>
            <p>Because Guacamole uses all touch events to drive mouse input,
                the normal gestures for scrolling the screen will not work.
                Depending on how big your screen is, and whether the display is
                currently zoomed, you have three options for panning the screen:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                        <p>Move the mouse</p>
                        <p>Moving the mouse beyond the bounds of the screen
                            of the device will cause the display to
                            automatically scroll until the mouse pointer is in
                            view again. This will only work if the screen is not
                            already fully visible.</p>
                    </li><li class="listitem">
                        <p>Long-press to bring up panning mode</p>
                        <p>If the remote display is already fully visible,
                            long-pressing will not bring up the magnifier, but
                            will instead put Guacamole in a panning mode. Arrows
                            will appear at the sides of the screen, and you can
                            drag around the screen as normal. Tapping on the
                            screen will put Guacamole in typing mode, allowing
                            you to type and use your native on-screen keyboard
                            (if any).</p>

            <p>Sound can sometimes cause problems if your browser is too slow or if you lack

                but misreport that they do to Guacamole, causing wasted bandwidth when Guacamole
                sends audio data that can't actually be played.</p>

            <p>Normally, scrolling around the screen is troublesome and distracting if the remote
                display you're using is larger than the display of your device. Because of this, the
                remote display will automatically fit itself to the available space by default. If

        <p>Users and connections can be administered from within the web interface if the
            underlying authentication module supports this. The only officially-supported
            authentication module supporting this is the MySQL authentication provider, which is
            documented in a different chapter.</p>
        <p>If you are using the default authentication mechanism, this
            section does not apply to you, and the Guacamole web interface will
            appear as it did in past releases. If, on the other hand, you are
            using the MySQL authentication provider, and you are logged in as an
            administrator, you will see a "Manage" button next to the "Logout"
            button at the top of the screen.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Clicking this button takes you to an administration screen where
            you can add or manipulate users and connections, depending on your
            permissions.</p>

            <a id="idp1158720" class="indexterm"></a>
            <p>Once at the administration screen, you will see two sections
                displaying all visible users and connections. The visibility of
                these sections depends on your user's permissions. If you lack
                permission to manage users, the user management section will not
                display. The same goes for management of connections.</p>
            <p>To add a new user, type the username of the new user within
                the text box inside the user management section, and click the
                "Add" button. The new user will be added and made available. The
                new user will have no access to any existing connections, no
                administrative privileges, and no password, and will not be able
                to login. You will need to set the user's password first in
                order to allow login.</p>

            <p>To edit a user, just click on the user you wish to edit. A small dialog will
                display allowing you to change the user's password, add or remove administrative
                permissions, and add or remove access to specific connections or groups.</p>
            <p>If you have delete permission on the user, you will also see a
                "Delete" button. Clicking this button will permanently delete
                the user.</p>

            <p>To add a new connection, click the "New Connection" button. A connection creation
                dialog will appear, allowing you to enter the details of the connection, such as its
                location, parameters, and name. This name should be descriptive, but must also be
                unique.</p>
            <p>Once you click "Save", the new connection will be added, but will initially only
                be usable by administrators and your current user. To add access to the new
                connection to another existing user, you must edit that user, checking the box
                corresponding to the new connection.</p>

            <p>Editing a connection works identically to editing a user.
                Click on the connection you wish to edit. A dialog will pop up
                displaying all parameters associated with the connection,
                allowing you to change the protocol, associated parameters, and
                to view the connection history.</p>
            <p>Connections can also be renamed or moved by altering the contents of the "Name" or
                "Location" fields.</p>
            <p>If you have delete permission on the connection, you will also
                see a "Delete" button. Clicking this button will permanently

                <p>Connections can be placed within groups for purposes of organization or load
                    balancing. Each group is displayed in connection lists as a "+" symbol followed
                    by its name. The group can be expanded revealing any contained connections or
                    groups. If the group is a balancing group, the group can be used as a
                    connection, and the least-used contained connection will be used.</p>
                <p>To add a new connection group, click the "New Group" button. A connection
                    group creation dialog will appear, allowing you to enter the details of the
                    group. Just as with connections, you can enter the location and name, which
                    should be descriptive and unique. Duplicate names are not allowed.</p>

                    dialog that appears, you can rename, move, and change the properties of existing
                    connection groups.</p>

                <p>Connection groups can be either "organizational" or "balancing". Each group
                    can contain any number of other connections or groups, but the semantics of the
                    group change depending on the type.</p>
                <p>An organizational group behaves exactly as a folder or directory in a file
                    system. It simply contains connections and other groups, but provides no other
                    behavior. Clicking on an organizational group within a connection list will
                    expand the group, revealing its contents.</p>
                <p>A balancing group behaves as a connection. It dynamically balances load across
                    the connections it contains, choosing the connection with the fewest number of
                    active users. Unlike organizational groups, clicking on a balancing group causes
                    a new connection to be opened. The actual underlying connection used depends on
                    which connection has the least load at the time the group was clicked.</p>
