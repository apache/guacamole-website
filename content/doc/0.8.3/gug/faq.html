                    a member of the project. </p><p>When the project reached the point where it was growing out of the
                    proof-of-concept phase, and needed a real home on the internet, we needed to
                    think of a name to register the project under. </p><p>Several acronyms were toyed with and discarded. We tried anagrams, but all
                    were too wordy and complex. We considered naming the project after a fish or an
                    animal, and after suggesting the guanaco, James Muehlner, a developer of the
                    project, suggested (randomly): "guacamole". </p><p>The name had a nice ring, we weren't embarrassed to use it, and it stuck. </p></td></tr>

            <tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The term "clientless" means that no specific client is needed. A Guacamole
                    user needs only have an HTML5 web browser installed, which is exceedingly
                    common; virtually all modern computers and mobile devices have such a browser
                    installed by default. </p><p>In this sense, Guacamole is "clientless" in that it does not require any
                    additional software to be installed beyond what is considered standard for any
                    computer. </p></td></tr>

            <tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The main technical answer here is that there is no need. The tunnel used by
                    Guacamole is exactly equivalent to WebSocket in terms of efficiency and latency,
                    and is more compatible with proxies and existing browsers. </p><p>The historical reason for not going with WebSocket initially was lack of
                    browser support and lack of a true standard. </p><p>Now that WebSocket is standardized, support for WebSocket is present in
                    Guacamole, but it is largely unused because the existing tunnel works just as
                    well and with more browsers. </p></td></tr>

            <tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>You need to enable automatic flushing of the proxy's buffer as it receives
                    packets. </p><p>Most proxies, including mod_proxy, buffer data received from the server, and
                    will not flush this data in real-time. Each proxy has an option to force
                    flushing of each packet automatically, as this is necessary for streaming
                    applications like Guacamole, but this is usually not enabled by default. </p><p>Because Guacamole depends on streaming to function, a proxy configured to not
                    automatically flush packets will disrupt the stream to the point that the
                    connection seems unreasonably slow, or just fails to establish altogether. </p><p>In the case of mod_proxy, this option is <code class="code">flushpackets=on</code>. </p></td></tr>

                    disrupting the stream used by Guacamole. </p><p>If you cannot change the settings of your proxy, using HTTPS instead of HTTP
                    should solve the problem. Proxies are required to stream HTTPS because of the
                    nature of SSL. Using HTTPS will allow Guacamole traffic to stream through
                    proxies unencumbered, even if you cannot access the proxy settings directly. </p></td></tr>

            <tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Usually, no. Previous requests for such licensing have been very one-sided and
                    there would be no direct or indirect benefit to the community and the project.
                    That said, we handle requests for licensing on a case-by-case basis. In general,
                    any special licensing has to somehow provide for the community and the
                    open-source project.</p></td></tr>
