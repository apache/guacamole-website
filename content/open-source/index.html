                <h1>Open Source</h1>

<p>Guacamole is an open source project. It is entirely free in every sense (under
the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>),
and will always be so.</p>

<p>We believe that being open source gives Guacamole distinct advantages over
purely-commercial alternatives. The public availability of the source means
that the codebase is readily modifiable and extendable. It can be embedded in
whole or in part in other projects. For the sake of the project and its
community, significant effort is made by the Guacamole team to keep the
codebase clean and readable. Guacamole is not a “black box”; you can read
through the codebase and see exactly what it does and why. Commercial support
is available, but because the software itself is free and open, there is no
aspect of vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>Guacamole is not public domain, but the Apache license is very permissive, and
as long as you follow it’s simple conditions, you can modify and include
Guacamole in other projects to your heart’s content, including commercial or
proprietary projects.</p>

<h2 id="contribute">Contributing</h2>

<p>If you believe you have a feature or bug fix that would benefit the project, or
simply wish to help other users, please feel free to subscribe to and use the
<a href="/support/#mailing-lists">project mailing lists</a>. To ensure issues are properly
tracked and development effort is not duplicated, all bugs or proposed
development should be reported by opening a new ticket in our
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE/">JIRA</a>.</p>

<p>Code contributions are also always welcome, but do have to go through a review
process. The code will more than likely be discussed and sent back a few times
in order to bring the style and implementation in line with the rest of the
Guacamole codebase.</p>

<p>If you are planning to contribute code, please keep in mind that the point of
contributing is to collaborate for the benefit of the project and its
community; it is a service you are choosing to provide because you believe, as
the members of the Guacamole project believe, that doing so works toward the
greater good. It is thus important to remember:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Expect honest and constructive criticism. It is a good thing.</li>
  <li>A project’s processes exist for a reason. The goal of contributing is to
work with the project for the common good, not fight against it.</li>
  <li>Develop against the most recent code on git. Patches against releases and
naive copies of entire files cannot be accepted as they lack context and
are likely out of date.</li>
  <li>Code must follow consistent style or it will become unreadable and
unmaintainable. Please read through our <a href="/guac-style/">style guidelines</a> and,
when in doubt, follow the style of the code you are modifying.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our full contribution guidelines can be found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONTRIBUTING</code> file in any
of our git repositories. If you need help getting started, the <a href="/api-documentation">API
documentation</a> is an excellent resource, as are the
<a href="/support/#mailing-lists">mailing lists</a> and the tutorials in <a href="/doc/gug/">the
manual</a>.</p>

    <p class="disclaimer">
        Apache Guacamole is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache
        Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is
        required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
        indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
        process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
        ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
        of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
        project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
